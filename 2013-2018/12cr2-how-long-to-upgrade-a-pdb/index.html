			<p>In the <a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/12cr2-upgrade-by-unplugplug-in-the-oracle-cloud-service/" target="_blank">previous post</a> I described how simple it is to unplug a PDB and plug it into a newer version CDB. One goal of dictionary separation in the multitenant architecture is to keep system objects on CDB$ROOT only. Knowing that an upgrade does not touch the application metadata and data, does this make PDB upgrade fast as a simple refresh of metadata links?

<h3>CDB$ROOT upgrade</h3>
<p>As a point of comparison I&#8217;ve run an upgrade on an empty CDB from 12.1.0.2 to 12.2.0.1 and here is the summary:</p>

</pre>
This was running on a Oracle Public Cloud DBaaS with two OCPUs which means four threads. It&#8217;s about 30 minutes to upgrade the system dictionary and all components.
Those are the times we are used to. Since 12<em>c</em> some operations are parallelized to make it faster than in previous versions.</p>
<p>The more components you install, the longer it takes. Even if it is recommended to install all components in a CDB in case a PDB needs it, you may think about this.</p>
<h3>PDB upgrade</h3>
<p>When you plug a PDB, you should not have all this work to do. You can expect that the metadata links and data links just work, now pointing to the new version. At most, a quick check or refresh may be necessary to ensure that object types did not change.</p>
<p>At UKOUG TECH16 in <a href="http://www.tech16.ukoug.org/default.asp?p=14778&amp;dlgact=shwprs&amp;prs_prsid=11878&amp;day_dayid=108" target="_blank">12c Multitenant: Not a Revolution, Just an Evolution</a> I demo how those links work internally and I show that running a full CATUPGRD.SQL on each container is not required to be run for each object. However, the DBUPGRADE script runs it. Let&#8217;s see if it is optimized for pluggable databases.</p>
<p>In 12.2 the command is easy:</p>
<p><pre>[oracle@HP122A tmp]$ $ORACLE_HOME/bin/dbupgrade -c PDB1</pre></p>
<p>You can see that it runs the catctl.pl commands that we used in 12.1</p>
<p><pre>Start processing of PDB1

Database time zone version is 18. It is older than current release time
zone version 26. Time zone upgrade is needed using the DBMS_DST package.

</pre></p>
<p>When you compare with a CDB$ROOT upgrade the gain is very small. We saved 25% of Oracle Server time. JVM and XDK was x2 faster. But finally, that&#8217;s only 5 minutes.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that the upgrade time depends on the components installed. Here is the percentage of time per component:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2016/11/CapturedbupgradePDB.png" rel="lightbox[12933]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2016/11/CapturedbupgradePDB.png" alt="CapturedbupgradePDB" width="988" height="599" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12934" /></a></p>
<p>About the core of the database, what we know as catalog/catproc, here is the detail showing which phases are run in parallel.
Note that the phase number is important because in 12.2 you can restart a failed upgrade from where it stopped.</p>

<h3>So what?</h3>
<p>From what we see, the multitenant architecture, with consolidation of the system directory in only one place &#8211; the CDB$ROOT &#8211; we have no gain in upgrade. In the current implementation (12.2.0.1) the same work is done on all containers, with only minimal optimization for pluggable databases where we have metadata links instead of full object metadata.
In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrading by plug-in or remote clone is faster than upgrading the whole CDB because CDB has more containers, such as PDB$SEED</li>
<li>But upgrading a single PDB, whatever the method is, is not faster than upgrading a non-CDB</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about upgrade of the container here. Transportable tablespaces/database is a different thing.</p>
<p>More about the Multitenant internals, dictionary separation, metadata links and data links (was called object links in 12.1) at UKOUG TECH 2016 conference next month.</p>
