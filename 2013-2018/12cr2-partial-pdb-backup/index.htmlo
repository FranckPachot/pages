			<p>I had a recent question about the following mention from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oracle-Database-Release-Multitenant-Press/dp/1259836096" target="_blank">12<em>c</em>R2 Multitenant</a> book, about Partial PDB backups:
<a href="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2017/04/CapturePArtialPDBBackup.png" rel="lightbox[16097]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2017/04/CapturePArtialPDBBackup.png" alt="CapturePArtialPDBBackup" width="706" height="198" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16100" /></a>.
Here is an example in 12.2 with local undo to illustrate the answer, which may help to understand what is a partial PDB backup.
<span id="more-16097"></span>
Of course, since 12<em>c</em>R1 you can backup PDB individually, without the CDB$ROOT, in the same way you can backup only a few tablespaces subset of a CDB. It can be part of your backup strategy, but it is not to be considered as a backup that you can restore elsewhere later. A PDB is not self-consistent without the PDB$ROOT except if is has been closed and unplugged. In 12.1 you cannot restore a partial PDB backup if you don&#8217;t have the CDB$ROOT at the same point in time, because the recovery phase will need to rollback the ongoing transactions, and this requires to have the UNDO tablespace recovered at the same point in time.</p>
<p>However, in 12.2 with LOCAL UNDO, the partial PDB backup contains the local UNDO tablespace and then it can be sufficient to do a PDB Point In Time Recovery within the same CDB. And, in this case only, it is not required to have a backup of the root.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s test it. I explicitly delete all backups</p>

<p>Thanks to LOCAL UNDO there is no need to restore the CDB$ROOT into an auxiliary instance, as it was the case for PDBPITR in 12.1 and then we can do PDBPITR without a backup of the root.</p>
<h3>So what?</h3>
<p>In theory, and as demonstrated above, including CDB$ROOT into a partial PDB backup is not mandatory in 12<i>c</i>R2 in local undo mode. However, keep in mind that this is for academic purpose only, not for real-life production. For short-term point in time, you will not use backups but flashback. For long-term restore, then you may have different reasons to restore the PDB elsewhere with its CDB$ROOT at the same point in time: some common objects (users, roles, directories, etc) may have changed. And anyway, your backup strategy should be at CDB level.</p>

		<p>Have you done any tests performing a PITR on a PDB and what happens with any existing incremental backups ?
I did some testing to simulate what happens during a normal weekly backup cycle with a
level 0 backup;
level 1 backup;
create restore point &#8216;test&#8217;
level 1 backup;
Restore pdb to restore point &#8216;TEST&#8221;;
recovery pdb to restore point &#8216;TEST';</p>
<p>As you pointed out, it no longer needs an auxiliary database to restore/recovery with local undo&#8230; BUT it also won&#8217;t use the incremental backup.. It restores the datafiles from the Level 0 backup and will only use archive logs to perform recovery. The incremental backups are ignored.  I&#8217;m curious if you&#8217;ve tried this, and know the reasoning for it.
