			<p>Easier than unplug/plug, you can move pluggable databases with remote cloning. It&#8217;s the same idea but you don&#8217;t have to manage the files yourself: the are shipped through database link. However, this uses the &#8216;remote file protocol&#8217; and it fails with version mismatch:
<pre>ORA-17628: Oracle error 17630 returned by remote Oracle server
ORA-17630: Mismatch in the remote file protocol version client  server</pre>
<span id="more-12944"></span></p>
<h3>Remote cloning</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ll describe the full operation of remote cloning in a future post. This is the error I got when I tried to remote clone from 12.1 to 12.2:
<pre>13:43:55 HP122A SQL&gt; create pluggable database PDB1 from PDB1@HP121A@HP121A keystore identified by "Ach1z0#d" relocate;
create pluggable database PDB1 from PDB1@HP121A@HP121A keystore identified by "Ach1z0#d"
*
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-17628: Oracle error 17630 returned by remote Oracle server
ORA-17630: Mismatch in the remote file protocol version client  server</pre></p>
<h3>Alert.log in target</h3>
<p>The error is received from the remote side. There is not a lot in local alert.log
<pre>create pluggable database PDB1 from PDB1@HP121A@HP121A keystore identified by * relocate

<h3>Alert.log in source</h3>
<p>More information about versions in the remote alert.log:

<h3>Patch</h3>
<p>Fortunately, version mismatch of remote file protocol has already been a problem in previous versions with other features that have to transport files, and a patch exists to bypass this version checking:</p>
<p>Patch 18633374: COPYING ACROSS REMOTE SERVERS: ASMCMD-8016, ORA-17628, ORA-17630, ORA-06512</p>
<p>And you can download it at <a href="https://updates.oracle.com/download/18633374.html">https://updates.oracle.com/download/18633374.html</a></p>
<p>My 12.1.0.2 DBaaS has the July 2016 PSU applied, as well as a merge of patches specific for the cloud:
<pre>[oracle@HP121 ~]$ $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch lspatches
19469538;
24310028;
22366322;
20475845;
18043064;
21132297;
23177536;Database PSU 12.1.0.2.160719, Oracle JavaVM Component (JUL2016)
23054246;Database Patch Set Update : 12.1.0.2.160719 (23054246)</pre></p>
<p>Today, there is no patch to download for this configuration. There is one for April 2016 PSU but there is still a conflict with patch 24310028</p>
<p>To be able to continue, I&#8217;ve removed following patches from the 12.1 source:
<pre>[oracle@HP121 ~]$ $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch rollback -id 23177536
[oracle@HP121 ~]$ $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch rollback -id 24310028</pre></p>
<p>But then, the parameter &#8220;encrypt_new_tablespaces&#8221; that has been introduced by 24310028 is unknown:
<pre>
SQL&gt; startup
ORA-01078: failure in processing system parameters
LRM-00101: unknown parameter name 'encrypt_new_tablespaces'</pre></p>
<p>You have to remove this one from the SPFILE. Basically it forces TDE when in the cloud, even when not specified in the DDL.</p>
<h3>So what?</h3>
<p>I hope this patch will be included in future DBaaS versions. Currently, the Oracle Public Cloud has no simple button to upgrade a service from 12.1 to 12.2 and the easiest way to do it should be remote cloning of PDB. But with those version mismatch and patch to apply, <a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/12cr2-upgrade-by-unplugplug-in-the-oracle-cloud-service/" target="_blank">unplug/plug</a> is probably easier.</p>

		<p>Hi Frank,</p>
<p>I found an article on the web about cloning a PDB from 12.1 to 12.2 and thought &#8211; what a great idea.  So I tried it out.</p>
<p><a href="https://mikedietrichde.com/2017/11/29/cloning-a-pdb-from-oracle-12-1-to-oracle-12-2" rel="nofollow">https://mikedietrichde.com/2017/11/29/cloning-a-pdb-from-oracle-12-1-to-oracle-12-2</a></p>
<p>Of course, it didn&#8217;t work.  I ran into the exact same problem you have outlined in this article.  You wrote it in late 2016, but I was just wondering if you&#8217;ve made any progress since or found any viable workarounds &#8211; besides reverting to unplug/plug?  Even the latter approach has its fair share of complications and hoops to jump through.</p>
<p>SQL&gt; create pluggable database NEW_EGDB105 from EGDB105@sourcedblink file_name_convert=(&#8216;C:\Oracle12102\CDB\ORADATA\CDB\EGDB105&#8242;, &#8216;D:\Shawn\CDB\ORADATA\CDB\EGDB105&#8242;);

		<p>Hi Shwan. The patch on the source is the solution.
Regards,
Franck.
