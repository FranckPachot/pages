			<p>This 12c &#8216;wrong results&#8217; issue is thoroughly described by Mike Dietrich (<a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/UPGRADE/entry/switch_off_rowsets_enabled_in" target="_blank">https://blogs.oracle.com/UPGRADE/entry/switch_off_rowsets_enabled_in</a>) and I&#8217;ve nothing to add.
This blog post is there to be used as a reference for the comment in the following recommendation that we give to our 12c customers:
<pre>
alter system set "_rowsets_enabled"=false comment='see http://blog.dbi-services.com/_rowsets_enabled' scope=both;
</pre>
Our best practice is to document any parameter that is set as a workaround so that it can be revert back when not needed anymore.

This post will be updated when a fix is available.
By the way, I recommend every Oracle DBA to follow Mike Dietrich blog.</p>
