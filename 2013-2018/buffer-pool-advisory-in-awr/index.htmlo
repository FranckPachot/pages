			<p>In <a href="https://blog.dbi-services.com/oracle-memory-advisors-how-relevant-">Oracle memory advisors: how relevant ?</a> I said that advisors are calculating their recommendations from statistics cumulated since the begining of the instance, even in AWR which is supposed to cover only a short period. Here is a quick test on buffer pool advisory to validate that assumption.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m running the following query to compare the &#8216;physical reads cache&#8217; from DBA_HIST_SYSSTATS and the value from the advisor in DBA_HIST_DB_CACHE:</p>
<pre class="brush: sql; gutter: true; first-line: 1">SQL&gt; column sysstat_value format 999G999G999G999
SQL&gt; column advisor_value format 999G999G999G999
SQL&gt; select snap_id,sysstat_value,advisor_value from
-- physical reads cache
(select snap_id,dbid,instance_number,stat_name,value sysstat_value from dba_hist_sysstat where stat_name like 'physical reads cache')
natural join
--  ACTUAL_PHYSICAL_READS
(select snap_id,dbid,instance_number,'ADVISOR',actual_physical_reads advisor_value from DBA_HIST_DB_CACHE_ADVICE where size_factor=1 and name='DEFAULT')
order by 1 desc,2,3;
</pre>
<p>Here is the result where I can see that they match for all snapshots I have in history:</p>
<pre class="brush: sql; gutter: true; first-line: 1">   SNAP_ID    SYSSTAT_VALUE    ADVISOR_VALUE

<p>I&#8217;m not sure about the three columns available in that view: PHYSICAL_READS BASE_PHYSICAL_READS ACTUAL_PHYSICAL_READS so let&#8217;s check that the one I used is the one that is displayed in an AWR report. Here is the latest report for snapshots 3024 to 3025:</p>

<p>Here is how I verified my assumtions, on an instance that is running for a long time. When you read at the advisor recommendations, you should know whether the activity since instance startup is relevant or not. And I don&#8217;t know how to reset the counters (except with an instance restart).</p>
