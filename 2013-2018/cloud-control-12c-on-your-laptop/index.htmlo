			<p>Today every DBA should have a lab on his laptop. This is where I reproduce most of cases before opening a SR, or to investigate something, to demo, to learn new features, or to prepare an OCM exam. I&#8217;ve a few basic VirtualBox VM with single instance databases (11g and 12c, SE and EE, CDB and non-CDB, etc). I&#8217;ve the RacAttack environement with a 3 nodes RAC in 12c on OEL7. But in order to prepare for OCM12c upgrade, I need also a Cloud Control 12c. Here is how I got it without having to install it.
<span id="more-5366"></span>
Oracle provides some VirtualBox images, and there is one with Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control 12c Release 5 (12.1.0.5) and a database (11.2.0.4) for the repository. </p>
<h3>Download</h3>
<p>You can get the image from: <a href="https://edelivery.oracle.com" target="_blank">https://edelivery.oracle.com</a></p>
<p>Filter products by &#8216;Linux/OVM/VMs&#8217; and search for &#8216;Enterprise Manager':</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/11/CaptureVBCC001.jpg" rel="lightbox[5366]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/11/CaptureVBCC001-300x126.jpg" alt="CaptureVBCC001" width="300" height="126" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5367" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s 17GB in total to download, so be patient:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/11/CaptureVBCC002.jpg" rel="lightbox[5366]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/11/CaptureVBCC002-300x33.jpg" alt="CaptureVBCC002" width="300" height="33" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5368" /></a></p>
<p>You can also download a wget script to get all files:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/11/CaptureVBCC003.jpg" rel="lightbox[5366]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/11/CaptureVBCC003-300x146.jpg" alt="CaptureVBCC003" width="300" height="146" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5369" /></a></p>
<p>So you have 6 files and you can unzip them. When you see the compression ratio you can ask why it is zipped&#8230;</p>
<p>Then concatenate all .ova files:
<pre>
C:\Users\frp&gt;cd /d F:\Downloads
F:\Downloads&gt;type VBox*.ova &gt; EM12cR5.ova
</pre>
and you can import it with VirtualBox as any OVA.</p>
<h3>Network</h3>
<p>I have all my VMs on the host-only network (192.168.78.1 in my case).
On the VM configuration, I set the first network card on &#8216;host only&#8217; network and the second one as NAT to be able to access internet.
If you imported the OVA without changing the MAC addresses, here they are: 0800274DA371 and 08002748F74B</p>
<p>Now I can start the VM and login as root &#8211; password welcome1</p>
<p>My keyboard is Swiss French layout, so I change it in System/Administration/keyboard</p>
<p>Then I want to be able to ssh to the machine so I set the network (System/Administration/Network)</p>
<p>Here is my configuration in my case;
<a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/11/CaptureVBCC011.jpg" rel="lightbox[5366]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/11/CaptureVBCC011-257x300.jpg" alt="CaptureVBCC011" width="257" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5372" /></a></p>
<p>Then I activate the interface and can connect with ssh:
$ ssh root@192.168.78.42</p>
<h3>Stop iptables as root</h3>
<p>I want to communicate with the other VMs to discover databases, and to access via web, so I disable the firewall:</p>
<p><pre>
[root@emcc ~]# /etc/init.d/iptables stop
Flushing firewall rules:                                   [  OK  ]
Setting chains to policy ACCEPT: filter                    [  OK  ]
Unloading iptables modules:                                [  OK  ]
[root@emcc ~]# chkconfig iptables off
</pre></p>
<p>then I can connect as oracle</p>
<p><pre>
$ su - oracle@192.168.78.42

And it&#8217;s ready. You can access to it from the VM console, or the host browser on https://192.168.78.42:7799/em</p>
<p>All passwords are welcome1.</p>
<p>You can discover the others hosts. I&#8217;ve put them n the /etc/hosts in the EM VM, and I&#8217;ve put the following line in all /etc/hosts where I want to install agents:
<pre>
192.168.78.42 emcc emcc.example.com
</pre></p>
<p>Hope it helps. There are things that are quicker to do from Cloud Control when you are in OCM exam so better to know it. However, don&#8217;t rely on that only as it may not be available for all exercises.</p>
