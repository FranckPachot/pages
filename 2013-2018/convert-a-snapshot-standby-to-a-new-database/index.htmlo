								<h1 class="entry-title">Convert a snapshot standby to a new database</h1>
		<div class="content-inner">
			
						
						
		   
			<p>A snapshot standby database is a nice solution when you want a temporary copy of the primary where you can do whatever you want (test a bug fix for example) and then convert it back to physical standby. But you don&#8217;t want to stay in that state definitely because you will accumulate archived logs from the changes done to the primary, and flashback logs for the changes made to the snapshot standby.</p>
<p>Here I&#8217;ll show how to finish it when you want a permanent new database. You can use that when you want to do a duplicate, but don&#8217;t know in advance which point-in-time should be used. Then you just configure a physical standby, convert it to snapshot standby, maybe flashback it the the required point. And once you have found the right point, then you finish it to have a new database name and DBID.</p>
<h3>The primary database</h3>
<p>Here is the primary on host VM111, db name is DEMO11 and db unique name is DEMO11.
I&#8217;m checking the DBID:</p>

<h3>Data Guard configuration</h3>
<p>The standby is on VM112, db name is DEMO11 and db unique name is DEMO12:</p>

</pre>
<p>I&#8217;ve a standby that is in sync.</p>
<h3>Snapshot standby</h3>
<p>I want to convert that standby to a new database. For the moment, I&#8217;ll only convert to a snapshot standby, so that I can flashback if I need to apply more archived logs later and start again from another point.</p>
<pre class="brush: actionscript3; gutter: true; first-line: 1">DGMGRL&gt; convert database demo12 to snapshot standby;

</pre>
<p>A restore point has been automatically created in order to be able to flashback to the point where log apply can continue:</p>

</pre>
<h3>Log shipping</h3>
<p>The snapshot standby is a database that is open read-write. The only difference with a new database (a duplicate for example) is that the DBID is still the same as the primary. But the advantage is that it stills receives the archived log and can be converted back to a standby database. Look at the primary and switch a few logfiles:</p>

<p>all the archived logs are there. You can see that DBID is the same as the primary.</p>
<h3>Transport and Apply lag</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s check the lag:</p>

Database - demo12

  Role:               SNAPSHOT STANDBY
  Transport Lag:      0 seconds (computed 1 second ago)
  Apply Lag:          5 minutes 4 seconds (computed 1 second ago)
  Instance(s):
    DEMO12

Database Status:
SUCCESS
</pre>
<p>I have an apply lag (the apply stopped when I converted the physical standby to a snapshot standby) but there is no transport lag.</p>
<p>At that point, I have my new database. I can do whatever I want, with the possibility to convert back to a standby, apply more archived logs, re-convert to a snapshot standby, etc. Then when I&#8217;m happy with it, I&#8217;ll finalize it:</p>
<ul>
<li>remove the standby configuration</li>
<li>delete all the unwanted archived logs</li>
<li>change DBID and DB_NAME to new ones</li>
</ul>
<h3>Remove standby database configuration</h3>
<p>This is done from Data Guard Broker and it will stop log shipping to the standby.</p>
<pre class="brush: actionscript3; gutter: true; first-line: 1">DGMGRL&gt; remove database demo12;
Removed database "demo12" from the configuration

</pre>
<p>At that point we can remove the archived logs on the standby site (rman delete archivelog all). We can also check the parameters that have been set by standby configuration(file name convert, fal_server, archive_lag_target) and set the dg_broker_start if you don&#8217;t want it anymore. The log_archive_config and log_archive_dest should have been reset properly by the &#8216;remove database from configuration&#8217;.</p>
<h3>DBNEWID</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m setting the DB_NAME to DEMO12 (instead of DEMO11) and I want a new DBID. This is done with &#8216;nid&#8217; when in mount:</p>
