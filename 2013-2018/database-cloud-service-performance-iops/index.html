			<p><img style="float:right" src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/08/cloud-300x300.png" alt="cloud" width="50" height="50" /> Having a database in the cloud is very nice. You add storage with a few clicks. You don&#8217;t have to think about the storage type (DAS, SAN, NAS), size of disks, stripe size, SSD, etc. But do you have the performance you expect? I&#8217;ve tested I/O in the Cloud that just opened for Europe, so that I get an image of performance when nobody&#8217;s there.</p>
<h1>SLOB</h1>
<p>If you want to test IOPS, the tool is Kevin Closson SLOB of course. It&#8217;s easy to setup, and I detailed that in the <a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/slob-in-the-cloud-how-to-check-cloud-services-performance/" title="SLOB in the Cloud: how to check Cloud Services performance">SLOB in the Cloud</a>.</p>
<p>I have a VM with a 100GB storage attached to it. The storage was defined as &#8216;latency&#8217; which definition is recommended for <em>low latency and high IOPS, such as for storing database files</em> according to <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/computecs_common/OCSUG/GUID-AFA0D511-915B-4221-9585-3E727885BFE1.htm#OCSUG140">documentation</a>. As of now, I&#8217;ve no (official) idea about the storage that is behind.</p>
<p>I run SLOB with default options except the scale that fit the maximum I have on that VM:</p>
<p><pre>UPDATE_PCT=25
RUN_TIME=300
WORK_LOOP=0
#SCALE=500M
SCALE=90000M
WORK_UNIT=64
REDO_STRESS=LITE
LOAD_PARALLEL_DEGREE=4</pre></p>
<h1>Optimized for latency</h1>
<p>So here is the result for the storage optimized for latency:</p>
<p><pre>
column event format a30
set linesize 120 pagesize 1000
select event,wait_time_micro,wait_count,wait_time_format from v$event_histogram_micro
 where event like 'db file sequential read' order by event,wait_time_micro;
</pre></p>

<p>On average, this is what we can call &#8216;low latency&#8217;. Let&#8217;s look at the detail.</p>
<p>Most of I/O come between 256&micro;s and 512&micro;s. That may suggest data was cached in the array behind Fiber Channel (roundtrip on FC being around 240&micro;s). Nothing below shows that nothing is cached on the server.</p>
<p>That may be an effect of my small amount of data (reading within 9000MB in 5 minutes) and the fact that there is not a lot of activity on that Cloud yet. We will see in the future how it evolves. A small part of I/O is within the mechanical disks latency (&gt; 4ms for 15000 RPM)</p>
<h1>Default storage</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ve run the same workload with a &#8216;default&#8217; storage witch is recommended by documentation for all other than datafiles.</p>

<p>From there I don&#8217;t see a big difference, except that the I/O that are in the range of mechanical disks seem to take longer. Do we hit there a storage that is more busy and have I/O calls in queue?</p>
<h1>Filesystem cache</h1>
<p>While I&#8217;m on these tests, and following Stefan Koehler comment (<a href="https://twitter.com/OracleSK/status/636904162802958336">https://twitter.com/OracleSK/status/636904162802958336</a>) I tested the same with the ext4 filesystem (filesystemio_options=none) and here it is:</p>

We clearly see two groups here. Filesystem cache hits around 16 microseconds and array head cache at the additional Fiber Channel transfer time.</p>
<h1>Comparison and guesses</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ve put that in Excel. The maximum number of IO done in 5 minutes are with the &#8216;latency&#8217; storage (remember, latency here means &#8216;low latency&#8217;).
When using the filesystem cache, a few IO are much quicker with no need to go to the array, but the remaining ones are a bit longer. It looks like the most read blocks that were serve the faster by the array are now served from the server (I&#8217;ve about 10GB for filesystem cache).</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/08/CaptureDBCSIO1.jpg" rel="lightbox[3381]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/08/CaptureDBCSIO1-300x181.jpg" alt="CaptureDBCSIO1" width="300" height="181" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3400" /></a></p>
<p>The peak for &#8216;default&#8217; and &#8216;latency&#8217; which are at the same place suggest that there is similar FC and head cache. Maybe the only difference is the disk speed?</p>
<p>Here is the same with a logarithmic scale in order to see the outliers better. It&#8217;s not enough to get good IOPS average. We don&#8217;t want to be the user that suffers from 100ms I/Os.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/08/CaptureDBCSIO2.jpg" rel="lightbox[3381]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/08/CaptureDBCSIO2-300x179.jpg" alt="CaptureDBCSIO2" width="300" height="179" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3399" /></a></p>
<p>The shape of &#8216;default&#8217; and &#8216;latency&#8217; is similar for what is in cache. But for those in the range of mechanic disks, the &#8216;latency&#8217; outperforms &#8216;default. So, follow the recommendation: use &#8216;latency&#8217; for databases.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve no explanation yet (comments welcome) why when using filecache we have less I/Os in the range of 2-8ms. filecache concerns the most frequently read blocks, so they should be in array cache when there is not filesystem cache.</p>
<h1>So what?</h1>
<p>What&#8217;s the point measuring a workload that fit all in cache? You have here the baseline of the maximum IOPS performance you can get from the Database Cloud Services. But be careful. When your data set is larger than those 100GB and the cloud is busy, most of your I/O will be above 1ms, but, it&#8217;s still good performance. That&#8217;s for a future post. I&#8217;ll keep an eye especially on those I/O in the 8-32ms.</p>
