			<p>I had a quick question today about Dbvisit replicate as a solution to feed an Operational Data Store. The need is to run some end-of-month jobs on data from a specific state. The best way is to stop the APPLY at that fixed state for the duration of the job. Then no need for flashback query and no risk of ORA-1555. And what if we know this state only afterwards? Easy if the target is in Enterprise Edition, running in FLASHBACK ON. Then how to continue the APPLY? It&#8217;s easy with Dbvisit replicate. Here is an example.
<span id="more-12475"></span>
One solution would be to create a restore point before doing the flashback in order to be able to get forth to the state before the flashback and re-start the APPLY where it was stopped. But if we do that, we need to open the database READ ONLY for running the job on it.
The other solution is to be able to re-start the apply at the point where the database has been flashed back. Do you think we have to get the right SCN, reset some configuration with it, etc? No. There&#8217;s something very simple and practical with Dbvisit replicate:</p>
<ul>
<li>The MINE configuration is stored in the source database</li>
<li>The APPLY configuration is stored in the destination database</li>
</ul>
<p>When you install Dbvisit for the first time, you may wonder why there is not only one repository. But this architecture makes it easy as the metadata is stored with the related data.</p>
<p>In my case, if I flashback the target database, the APPLY repository is flashed back as well, so the APPLY continues exactly at the right point</p>
<p>But just in case let&#8217;s test it.
I use my old #repattack VMs, which explains why the dbvrep version is old, and why the time is on New Zealand time zone. Here is a running replication:

<p>I want to flashback to a quarter before, at 09:00, and because I&#8217;m in Oracle XE I&#8217;ll restore rather than flashback:</p>

<p>Things are simple when they are well designed. The APPLY has to synchronize with the destination, so they have put the APPLY repository into the destination. No problem if the replication went further than the point in time you need to freeze. Any solution is possible as long ans the whole database is consistent: Flashback database, PITR, snapshots, etc.</p>
