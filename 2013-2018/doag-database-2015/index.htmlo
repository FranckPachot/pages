			<p>It was my first time at DOAG Datenbank in Dusseldorf. </p>
<p>My understanding of German is very limited. I&#8217;m French, I&#8217;ve learned German at school but then didn&#8217;t practice. Now that I&#8217;m living in Switzerland it would help but when I tried to remember something from school time it failed with Ora-1555: Snapshot too old&#8230;</p>
<p>So I was there because I presented SQL Plan Directives &#8211; in English &#8211; and I really appreciate that DOAG has accepted a session in English in a German event. It seems that it was ok for the attendees as well: lot of people, interaction&#8230; language is not a barrier, good that we can overcome the Babel thing. In IT we have a lot of non-standards (keyboards, endianess, charactersets, CR+LF,&#8230;) but at least we all speak and understand the same language &#8211; a basic subset of English. Basic is not pejorative here. With less words we have to focus on the main points without litterature, and that makes good technical presentations.</p>
<p>That DOAG event is like the other DOAG event I know &#8211; the DOAG conference in November: very well organized in a very nice place. Near the airport makes it accessible. And the same thing that I really appreciate at the DOAG conference: rooms are like a circle around the place where people meet, talk, eat, etc. I don&#8217;t like those events where rooms are at the end of several corridors. The DOAG events, besides the quality of the sessions, are a greet place to meet. I&#8217;ve met in &#8216;real&#8217; people I appreciate though their blogs or tweets. I&#8217;ve met people that have read my articles (so it seems that the German transation of my Docker article was good). I&#8217;ve met people that have migrated to 12c (and they encountered SQL Plan Directives, for the good and the less good consequences). People don&#8217;t hesitate to give you direct feedback about the good and bad points of your session and I like that. We are there to share and the places chosen by DOAG helps that.</p>
<p>I attended the sessions where I can understand something: slides in English, and demos, helps that. Here is quick shot at those I appreciated the most:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MartinKlierDBA">Martin Klier</a> on In-Memory column store: I like when presentations go into the details. For example, everybody talks about vector processing (SIMD) when processing a column store, but rarely give an idea about the size of that vector. Martin did: current CPU can have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">256 bits register.</a></p>
<p>Martin&#8217;s core message is: InMemory ist cool. Cool reicht nicht. UseCase muß passen.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/LotharFlatz">Lothar Flatz</a> has his own style which makes him a great speaker, presenting scientific approach to performance as if telling a story. And in an interactive way which forces us to think about the problem. Very interresting &#8216;middle ground in the buffer cache&#8217;. Looking at segments statistics and comparing the ratio between physical and logical reads to see who is using the cache efficiently or not.</p>
<p>Lothar&#8217;s first message is: Before we start tuning, let us tidy up the buffer cache.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, thanks again DOAG and I hope to see everybody in Nürnberg on November.</p>
