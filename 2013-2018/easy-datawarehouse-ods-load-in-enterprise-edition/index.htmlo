			<p>In a <a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/otn-appreciation-day-transportable-tablespaces/" target="_blank">previous post</a>, tribute to transportable tablespaces (TTS), I said that TTS is also used to move data quickly from operational database to a datawarehouse ODS. For sure, you don&#8217;t transport directly from the production database because TTS requires that the tablespace is read only. But you can transport from a snapshot standby. Both features (transportable tablespaces and Data Guard snapshot standby) are free in Enterprise Edition without option. Here is an exemple to show that it&#8217;s not difficult to automate
<span id="more-12308"></span></p>
<p>I have a configuration with the primary database &#8220;db1a&#8221;</p>
<p><pre>DGMGRL&gt; show configuration

Configuration - db1

  Protection Mode: MaxPerformance
  Members:
  db1a - Primary database
    db1b - Physical standby database

Fast-Start Failover: DISABLED

Configuration Status:
SUCCESS   (status updated 56 seconds ago)

DGMGRL&gt; show database db1b

Database - db1b

  Role:               PHYSICAL STANDBY
  Intended State:     APPLY-ON
  Transport Lag:      0 seconds (computed 0 seconds ago)
  Apply Lag:          0 seconds (computed 0 seconds ago)
  Average Apply Rate: 0 Byte/s
  Real Time Query:    ON
  Instance(s):
    db1

Database Status:
SUCCESS</pre></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve a few tables in the tablespace USERS and this is what I want to transport to ODS database:</p>
<p><pre>SQL&gt; select segment_name,segment_type,tablespace_name from user_segments;

SEGMENT_NAME SEGMENT_TY TABLESPACE
------------ ---------- ----------
DEPT         TABLE      USERS
EMP          TABLE      USERS
PK_DEPT      INDEX      USERS
PK_EMP       INDEX      USERS
SALGRADE     TABLE      USERS</pre></p>
<h3>Snapshot standby</h3>
<p>With Data Guard it is easy to open temporarily the standby database. Just convert it to a snapshot standby with a simple command:</p>
<p><pre>
DGMGRL&gt; connect connect system/oracle@//db1b
DGMGRL&gt; convert database db1b to snapshot standby;
Converting database "db1b" to a Snapshot Standby database, please wait...
Database "db1b" converted successfully</pre></p>
<h3>Export</h3>
<p>Here you can start to do some Extraction/Load but better to reduce this window where the standby is not in sync. The only thing we will do is export the tablespace in the fastest way: TTS.</p>
<p>First, we put the USERS tablespace in read only:</p>
<p><pre>SQL&gt; connect system/oracle@//db1b
Connected.

SQL&gt; alter tablespace users read only;
Tablespace altered.</pre></p>
<p>and create a directory to export metadata:</p>
<p><pre>SQL&gt; create directory TMP_DIR as '/tmp';
Directory created.</pre></p>
<p>Then export is easy</p>
<p><pre>SQL&gt; host expdp system/oracle@db1b transport_tablespaces=USERS directory=TMP_DIR
Starting "SYSTEM"."SYS_EXPORT_TRANSPORTABLE_01":  system/********@db1b transport_tablespaces=USERS directory=TMP_DIR

Job "SYSTEM"."SYS_EXPORT_TRANSPORTABLE_01" successfully completed at Wed Oct 19 21:03:36 2016 elapsed 0 00:00:52</pre></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve the metadata in /tmp/expdat.dmp and the data in /u02/oradata/db1/users01.dbf. I copy this datafile directly in his destination for the ODS database:</p>
<p><pre>[oracle@VM118 ~]$ cp /u02/oradata/db1/users01.dbf /u02/oradata/ODS/users01.dbf
</pre>
This is physical copy, which is the fastest data movement we can do.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m ready to import it into my ODA database, but I can already re-sync the standby database because I extracted everything I wanted.</p>
<h3>Re-sync the physical standby</h3>
<p><pre>DGMGRL&gt; convert database db1b to physical standby;
Converting database "db1b" to a Physical Standby database, please wait...
Operation requires shut down of instance "db1" on database "db1b"
Shutting down instance "db1"...
Connected to "db1B"
Database closed.
Database dismounted.
ORACLE instance shut down.
Operation requires start up of instance "db1" on database "db1b"
Starting instance "db1"...
ORACLE instance started.
Database mounted.
Connected to "db1B"
Continuing to convert database "db1b" ...
Database "db1b" converted successfully
DGMGRL&gt;</pre></p>
<p>The duration depends on the time to flashback the changes (and we did no change here as we only exported) and the time to apply the redo stream generated  since the convert to snapshot standby (which duration has been minimized to its minimum).</p>
<p>This whole process can be automated. We did that at several customers and it works well. No need to change anything unless you have new tablespaces.</p>
<h3>Import</h3>
<p>Here is the import to the ODS database and I rename the USERS tablespace to ODS_USERS:</p>
<p><pre>SQL&gt; host impdp system/oracle transport_datafiles=/u02/oradata/db2B/users02.dbf directory=TMP_DIR remap_tablespace=USERS:ODS_USERS
Master table "SYSTEM"."SYS_IMPORT_TRANSPORTABLE_01" successfully loaded/unloaded

Job "SYSTEM"."SYS_IMPORT_TRANSPORTABLE_01" completed with 3 error(s) at Wed Oct 19 21:06:18 2016 elapsed 0 00:00:10
</pre></p>
<p>Everything is there. You have all your data in ODS_USERS. You can have other data/code in this database. Only the ODS_USERS tablespace have to be dropped to be re-imported. You can have your staging tables here adn even permanent tables.</p>
<h3>12<em>c</em> pluggable databases</h3>
<p>In 12.1 it is even easier because the multitenant architecture gives the possibility to transport the pluggable databases in one command, through file copy or database links. It is even faster because metadata are transported physically with the PDB SYSTEM tablespace. I said multitenant architecture here, and didn&#8217;t mention any option. Multitenant option is needed only if you want multiple PDBs managed by the same instance. But if you want the ODS database to be an exact copy of the operational database, then you don&#8217;t need any option to unplug/plug.</p>
<p>In 12.1 you need to put the source in read only, so you still need a snapshto standby. And from my test, there&#8217;s no problem to convert it back to physical standby after a PDB has been unplugged. In next release, we may not need a standby because it has been announced that PDB can be cloned online.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll explain the multitenant features available without any option (in 12<em>c</em> current and next release) at Oracle Geneva office on 23rd of November:</p>
