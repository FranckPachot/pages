			<p>In a <a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/exadata-x-5-bare-metal-vs-ovm/" target="_blank">previous post</a> I tried to compare a single thread workload between Exadata X5 Bare Metal and Virtualized. The conclusions were that there is no huge differences, and that this kind of comparison is not easy.

About the comparison is not easy, some reasons have been nicely detailed by Lonny Niederstadt in this <a href="https://twitter.com/sqL_handLe/status/759000409520209920" target="_blank">twitter thread</a></p>
<p>Besides the single thread tests, I did a test with 50 sessions doing updates on a small data set. It&#8217;s a 50 session SLOB with SCALE=100M WORK_UNIT=64 UPDATE_PCT=100 and a small buffer cache.</p>
<p>Here are the load profiles, side by side:</p>

<p>This is roughly what you can expect from OLTP workload: small data set that fits in flash cache, high redo rate. Of course in OLTP you will have a higher buffer cache, but this is not what I wanted to measure here. It seems that the I/O performance is slightly better in bare metal. This is what we also see on averages:</p>

<p>It&#8217;s interesting to see that even when on I/O bound system there are no significant waits on log file sync.</p>

<p>Same conclusions here: the &#8216;less than 256 microseconds&#8217; occurs more frequently in bare metal than virtualized.</p>
<p>For the reference, those tests wer done on similar configuration (except virtualization): X5-2L High Capacity with 3 storage cells, version cell-12.1.2.3.1_LINUX.X64_160411-1.x86_64, flashcache in writeback. Whole system started before the test. This test is the only thing running on the whole database machine.</p>
