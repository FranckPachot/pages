			<p>The Exadata X5 can be installed Bare Metal or Virtualized. The latter one, Oracle VM allows to create multiple clusters on one machine, is more complex for installation and for storage capacity planning. But it allows a small flexibility on options licencing. Those are the real challenges behind the choice. However, when we talk about virtualization, most of questions are about the overhead. Last week, we did some tests on same machine with different configuration, thanks to <a href="http://www.arrowecs.ch/en/" target="_blank">Arrow</a> Oracle Authorized Solution Center.
<span id="more-10040"></span>
Comparison is not easy. Bare Metal has all resources. Virtualized has to distribute resources. And this test is very specific: all I/O hitting the &#8216;extreme&#8217; flash cache because I don&#8217;t expect any virtualization overhead to be in milliseconds. So, don&#8217;t expect some universal conclusions from those tests. And don&#8217;t hesitate to comment about my way to read those numbers.</p>
<h3>CPU</h3>
<p>Do not expect a benchmark that shows the maximum capacity of the machine here. I&#8217;m comparing a bare metal node with 36 cores with a VM with 4 vCPUS. So I&#8217;ll compare a one thread workload only: <a href="https://kevinclosson.net/slob/" target="_blank">SLOB</a> with one session and SCALE=100M UPDATE_PCT=0 RUN_TIME=120 WORK_UNIT=64</p>

<p>In two minutes we did more work here. Timed events show statistics about the &#8216;cell single block reads&#8217; which are nothing else than &#8216;db file sequential read&#8217; renamed to look more &#8216;Exadata&#8217;. No SmartScan happens here as they go to buffer cache and we cannot do any filtering for blocks that will be shared with other sessions. </p>

<p>Lower latency here on average which explains why we did more work. But no conclusion before we know where the latency comes from. Averages hides the details, and it&#8217;s the same with the &#8216;IO Profile&#8217; section:</p>

<p>We already know that there were more work on the OVM run but comparing the &#8216;per transaction&#8217; statistics show similar things but a bit more &#8216;flash cache&#8217; &#8216;optimized&#8217; I/O in the second run.
Of course, even if it&#8217;s the same machine, it has been re-imaged, database re-created, different volume and capacity. So maybe I hit more the cell flash on the second run than on the first one and more reads on spinning disks can explain the difference on single block reads latency.</p>
<p>We need to get beyond the averages with the wait event histograms. They don&#8217;t show lower than millisecond in the AWR report (I&#8217;ve opened an enhancement request for 12.2 about that) but I collected them from the V$EVENT_HISTOGRAM_MICRO</p>

<p>In the first run we see more reads around 8ms which confirms the previous guess that we had more flash cache hit on the second run.
The waits between 128 and 512 milliseconds are from the cell flash storage and this is where I want to see if virtualization has an overhead.
I&#8217;ve put it in color there where it&#8217;s easier to visualize that most of the reads are in the 128-256 range. Bare Metal in blue, OVM in orange. </p>

<p>In Bare Metal, most of the reads are faster than 256 microseconds. In virtualized there are some significant reads are above. This may be cause by virtualization but anyway that&#8217;s not a big difference. I don&#8217;t think that virtualization overhead is an important criteria when choosing how to install your Exadata. Storage capacity planning is the major criteria: consolidate all storage in two diskgroups (DATA and RECO) for all databases, or partition them for each cluster. choice is about manageability and agility in provisioning vs. licence optimization.</p>
