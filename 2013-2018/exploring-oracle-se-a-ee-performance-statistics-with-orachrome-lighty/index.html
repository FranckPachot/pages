At dbi services, we really like Lighty for Oracle, a tool which helps exploring performance statistics whether they originate from AWR (available only in Enterprise Edition with Diagnostic Pack option) or from Statspack (available via Standard Edition). As a matter of fact, we like it so much that we have became Orachrome Partner.</p>
<p>If you want to try it out for yourselves, there is a free trial <a href="https://orachrome.com/download.php">here</a>. If you have Statspack installed (see spdoc.txt in ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin to install it), you can immediately use Lighty.</p>
<p>Let me show you how to install it. First, you have to define a connection (shortcut: Ctrl-A):</p>
<p><a class="easyblog-thumb-preview" title="CaptureLighty001.PNG" href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/images/easyblog_images/139/CaptureLighty001.PNG" rel="lightbox[437]"><img title="CaptureLighty001.PNG" src="../images/easyblog_images/139/CaptureLighty001.PNG" alt="CaptureLighty001.PNG" /></a></p>
<p>It is a jdbc connection without the need to install anything else. You just need the listener host, port, and service:</p>
<p><a class="easyblog-thumb-preview" title="CaptureLighty002.PNG" href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/images/easyblog_images/139/CaptureLighty002.PNG" rel="lightbox[437]"><img title="CaptureLighty002.PNG" src="../images/easyblog_images/139/CaptureLighty002.PNG" alt="CaptureLighty002.PNG" /></a></p>
<p>As you are on Oracel Standard Edition, you don&#8217;t have Diagnostic Pack nor tuning Pack.
But you have installed Statspack, and you will install L-ASH very soon:</p>
<p><a class="easyblog-thumb-preview" title="CaptureLighty003.PNG" href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/images/easyblog_images/139/CaptureLighty003.PNG" rel="lightbox[437]"><img title="CaptureLighty003.PNG" src="../images/easyblog_images/139/CaptureLighty003.PNG" alt="CaptureLighty003.PNG" /></a></p>
<p>Now, you can install L-ASH as documented. But the goal of this post is to show what you can get it immediately. Go to the menu: Reports &gt; DB Statistics &gt; Past Activity (Statspack)
You can select a day and see the snapshots. The color bar immediately shows when the activity was high:</p>
<p><a class="easyblog-thumb-preview" title="CaptureLighty004.PNG" href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/images/easyblog_images/139/CaptureLighty004.PNG" rel="lightbox[437]"><img title="CaptureLighty004.PNG" src="../images/easyblog_images/139/CaptureLighty004.PNG" alt="CaptureLighty004.PNG" /></a></p>
<p>Then you can choose the graphical equivalent for my preferred Statspack sections:
Top Events:</p>
<p><a class="easyblog-thumb-preview" title="CaptureLighty005.PNG" href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/images/easyblog_images/139/CaptureLighty005.PNG" rel="lightbox[437]"><img title="CaptureLighty005.PNG" src="../images/easyblog_images/139/CaptureLighty005.PNG" alt="CaptureLighty005.PNG" /></a></p>
<p>Top Segments (change the Statspack level to 7 for that):</p>
<p><a class="easyblog-thumb-preview" title="CaptureLighty007.PNG" href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/images/easyblog_images/139/CaptureLighty007.PNG" rel="lightbox[437]"><img title="CaptureLighty007.PNG" src="../images/easyblog_images/139/CaptureLighty007.PNG" alt="CaptureLighty007.PNG" /></a></p>
<p>And of course Top SQL Statements:</p>
<p><a class="easyblog-thumb-preview" title="CaptureLighty006.PNG" href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/images/easyblog_images/139/CaptureLighty006.PNG" rel="lightbox[437]"><img title="CaptureLighty006.PNG" src="../images/easyblog_images/139/CaptureLighty006.PNG" alt="CaptureLighty006.PNG" /></a></p>
<p>For each statement (click on its sql_id) you will have everything: SQL text, execution plan, statistics.
If you like the tool, it&#8217;s time to go further and install L-ASH so that you can mine from the Activity Viewer tab, which is the most valuable feature of Lighty for Oracle.</p>
