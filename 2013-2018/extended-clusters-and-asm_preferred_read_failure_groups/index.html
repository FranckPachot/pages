			<p>When you have 2 sites that are not too far you can build an extended cluster. You have one node on each site. And you can also use ASM normal redundancy to store data on each site (each diskgroup has a failure group for each site). Writes are multiplexed, so the latency between the two sites increases the write time. By default, reads can be done from one or the other site. But we can, and should, define that preference goes to local reads.
<span id="more-8855"></span></p>
<p>The setup is easy. In the ASM instance you list the failure groups that are on the same site, with the &#8216;asm_preferred_read_failure_groups&#8217; parameter. You set that with an ALTER SYSTEM SCOPE=spfile SID=&#8230; because you will have different values for each instance. Of course, that supposes that you know the SID of the ASM instance that run on a specific site. If you are in Flex ASM, don&#8217;t ask. Wait 12.2 or read Bertrand Drouvot <a href="https://bdrouvot.wordpress.com/2013/07/02/flex-asm-12c-12-1-and-extended-rac-be-careful-to-unpreferred-read/" target="_blank">blog post</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m on an extended cluster where the two sites have between 0.3 and 0.4 milliseconds of latency. I&#8217;m checking the storage with SLOB so this is the occasion to check how asm_preferred_read_failure_groups helps in I/O latency.</p>
<p>I use a simple SLOB configuration for physical I/O, read only, single block, and check the wait event histogram for &#8216;db file sequential read&#8217;.
Here is an example of output:

It seems that half of the reads are served by the array cache and the other half are above disk latency time.</p>
<p>Now I set the asm_preferred_read_failure_groups to the remote site, to measure reads coming from there.
<pre>
alter system set asm_preferred_read_failure_groups='DATA1_MIR.FAILGRP_SH' scope=memory;
</pre></p>

<p>The pattern is similar except that I&#8217;ve nothing lower than 0.5 millisecond. I/Os served by the storage cache have there the additional latency of 0.3 milliseconds from the remote site. Of course, when we are above the millisecond, we don&#8217;t see the difference.</p>

alter system set asm_preferred_read_failure_groups='DATA1_MIR.FAILGRP_VE' scope=memory;

Here the fast reads are around 0.5 millisecond. And one thousand reads had a service time lower than 0.3 milliseconds, which was not possible when reading from the remote site.</p>
<p>Here is the pattern in in an Excel chart where you see no big difference for latency above 4 milliseconds.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2016/05/CapturePrefFailGrp.png" rel="lightbox[8855]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2016/05/CapturePrefFailGrp.png" alt="CapturePrefFailGrp" width="1151" height="837" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8856" /></a></p>
<p>With efficient storage array, extended cluster latency may penalize performance of writes. However, writes should be asynchronous (DBRW) so the latency is not part of the user response time. I&#8217;m not talking about redo logs here. For redo you have to choose to put it on a local only diskgroup or on a mirrored one. This depends on availability requirements and latency between the two sites. </p>
<p>So, when you have non uniform latency among failure groups, don&#8217;t forget to set asm_preferred_read_failure_groups. And test it with SLOB as I did here. Wat you expect from theorical latencies should be visible in the wait event histogram.</p>

		<p>Hello Franck,</p>
<p>you could also simulate the impact of the ASM preferred read vithout actually implementing it, for example that way: <a href="https://bdrouvot.wordpress.com/2014/08/11/simulate-and-visualize-the-impact-of-the-asm-preferred-feature-on-the-read-iops-and-throughput/" rel="nofollow">https://bdrouvot.wordpress.com/2014/08/11/simulate-and-visualize-the-impact-of-the-asm-preferred-feature-on-the-read-iops-and-throughput/</a></p>
<p>Thx
