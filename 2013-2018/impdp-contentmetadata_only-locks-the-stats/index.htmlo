			<p>With Oracle you can learn something every day. Today, preparing a migration to 12.2, I found all tables had locked statistics. I learned that it is the expected behavior since 10.2 when importing metadata_only including statistics, to avoid that the automatic job gathering comes and replaces the stats by &#8216;0 rows&#8217;.

It is documented in <a href="https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocContentDisplay?id=415081.1" target="_blank">DataPump Import Without Data Locks Table Statistics (Doc ID 415081.1)</a> but as I was really surprised about that (and also frustrated to learn a 10.2 thing when migrating to 12.2) that I wanted to test myself.</p>
<p>I create a table DEMO with statistics:
<pre>
SQL&gt; connect sys/oracle@//localhost/pdb1 as sysdba
Connected.
SQL&gt; create table demo.demo as select * from dual;
Table created.

SQL&gt; create index demo.demo on demo.demo(dummy);
Index created.

SQL&gt; exec dbms_stats.gather_table_stats('DEMO','DEMO');
PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.

SQL&gt; create or replace directory TMP as '/tmp';
Directory created.

SQL&gt; select count(*) from DEMO.DEMO;

  COUNT(*)
----------
         1

SQL&gt; select object_type from dba_objects where owner='DEMO' and object_name='DEMO';

OBJECT_TYPE
-----------------------
TABLE
INDEX

SQL&gt; select owner,table_name,last_analyzed,stattype_locked,num_rows from dba_tab_statistics where owner='DEMO' and table_name='DEMO';

OWNER      TABLE_NAME           LAST_ANALYZED        STATTYPE_LOCKED        NUM_ROWS
---------- -------------------- -------------------- -------------------- ----------
DEMO       DEMO                 06-SEP-17                                          1
</pre></p>
<p>I export it:

<p>If I check the statistics:
<pre>
SQL&gt; select owner,table_name,last_analyzed,stattype_locked,num_rows from dba_tab_statistics where owner='DEMO' and table_name='DEMO';

OWNER      TABLE_NAME           LAST_ANALYZED        STATTYPE_LOCKED        NUM_ROWS

</pre></p>
<p>Stats are locked. I suppose that the idea is that you have the tables with same statistics as production for example, and you can load them with a subset of data but expect the same execution plans as in production. But this is not what I want for a migration.</p>
<p>One possibility is to unlock the stats once you have imported the data.</p>
<p>The other possibility is to import metadata without the statistics:
<pre>
Connected to: Oracle Database 12c Enterprise Edition Release 12.2.0.1.0 - 64bit Production
Master table "SYS"."SYS_IMPORT_TABLE_01" successfully loaded/unloaded
Starting "SYS"."SYS_IMPORT_TABLE_01":  "sys/********@//localhost/pdb1 AS SYSDBA" tables=DEMO.DEMO directory=TMP content=metadata_only exclude=index exclude=table_statistics
Processing object type TABLE_EXPORT/TABLE/TABLE
Job "SYS"."SYS_IMPORT_TABLE_01" successfully completed at Wed Sep 6 21:11:03 2017 elapsed 0 00:00:03
</pre></p>
<p>Then the table statistics are not locked:
<pre>
OWNER      TABLE_NAME           LAST_ANALYZED        STATTYPE_LOCKED        NUM_ROWS
---------- -------------------- -------------------- -------------------- ----------
DEMO       DEMO
</pre></p>
<p>Once you have changed what you want on the tables, you import the data (table_exists_action=truncate) and then you import the remaining: indexes, ref_constraints, triggers.
This is where you can also add include=table_statistics:
<pre>
Starting "SYS"."SYS_IMPORT_TABLE_01":  "sys/********@//localhost/pdb1 AS SYSDBA" tables=DEMO.DEMO directory=TMP table_exists_action=truncate include=index include=table_statistics
Processing object type TABLE_EXPORT/TABLE/INDEX/INDEX
Processing object type TABLE_EXPORT/TABLE/INDEX/STATISTICS/INDEX_STATISTICS
Processing object type TABLE_EXPORT/TABLE/STATISTICS/TABLE_STATISTICS
Processing object type TABLE_EXPORT/TABLE/STATISTICS/MARKER
</pre></p>
<p>So that you have the statistics from the source, unlocked.
<pre>
