			<h3>It&#8217;s next week at #DOAG2015</h3>
<p>Interested in a deep dive of logical replication? Let&#8217;s try it. The best way to learn is to try it and this is the idea of #RepAttack where you can quickly install a replication configuration on your laptop, using VirtualBox, Oracle XE, and Dbvisit replicate trial version.
<span id="more-5296"></span>
Last year Jan Karremans (<a href="http://www.jk-consult.nl/" target="_blank">www.jk-consult.nl</a>) organized a #RepAttack which was cool but we were in a room at the end of the 3rd floor and many people hesitated to come inside. So for this year we had the idea to do it in a different way: fix a rendez-vous at the 2nd floor in front of the stairs:</p>
<h3> Wednesday, November 18 &#8211; 2:00pm</h3>
<p>There we meet up, give a brief intro of #RepAttack, distribute USB stick with all required software, and we will find a place to go to put the laptops on a table (or not &#8211; it&#8217;s lap-top afterall) and start installing/configuring.</p>
<p>Why on the 2nd floor? Because all Dbvisit partners are there: Opitz, Herrmann &amp; Lenz Services GmbH and dbi services are just at the arrival of the stairs and Robotron a few steps from there. </p>
<p><img style="float:left;margin-right:20px" src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/11/LiveDemo_DSC6993-300x239.jpg" alt="LiveDemo_DSC6993" width="300" height="239" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5297" />
And at dbi services, we have the &#8216;live demo&#8217; screen that we use for any on-demand demo for people coming at the booth. There I can show you how the #Repattack will look like before you do it on your laptop.</p>
<p>Hope to see lot of people next week.</p>
<p>The prereqs for the laptops are:</p>
<p>•  At least 2.3 Gb RAM per VM. 5 Gb in total as 2 VMs will be built. A laptop with 8 Gb is recommended.
•  At least 17Gb of free space. 25 Gb is recommended.
•  2 GHz Processor (a lesser processor will be acceptable but slower)
•  Admin privileges on your host machine are required to install VirtualBox.
•  Either Windows, Linux, Mac OS X operating system on your host machine. &#8211; </p>
<p>If you want to look at the cookbook, it&#8217;s online: <a href="https://dbvisit.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPA11XE/RepAttack+11g+XE+Home" target="_blank">https://dbvisit.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPA11XE/RepAttack+11g+XE+Home</a></p>
<p>If you have an HP laptop, please check before that you can start a 64-bit VM on it because experience at #rackattack shows that we can spend a lot of time finding the right BIOS settings. But don&#8217;t worry, we are there to help.</p>
<p>Not at DOAG? Then see you next month in Birmingham, there&#8217;s another <a href="http://www.tech15.ukoug.org/default.asp?p=14230" target="_blank">#RepAttack</a> there.</p>
