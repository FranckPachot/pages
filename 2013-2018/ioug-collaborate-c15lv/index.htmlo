<h3>RAC attack</h3>
<p>You want to learn and practice RAC on your laptop? One of the best ways to learn new technology is with hands-on experience. During this workshop you will have an opportunity to set up Oracle 12c Real Application Cluster environment on your laptop, go through advanced RAC related setup scenarios or work together with other technical geeks on solving RAC related challenges.
I&#8217;ll participate with my friends as a RAC attack ninjas, to help you address any related issues and guide you through the setup process. Come with your laptop and download oracle before (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/rac12c-dl">http://tinyurl.com/rac12c-dl</a> &#8211; 4 files for database and grid infrastructure)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not only technology, but also Networking, Beer + Pizza, and new T-SHIRTs.</p>
