								<h1 class="entry-title">Measuring IOPS on XtremIO</h1>
		<div class="content-inner">
			
						
						
		   
			<p>Today, we can put our database on very efficient storage. EMC XtremIO is one of them.
In this blog post, I&#8217;ll show how to look at the IO performance from Enterprise Manager, Orachrome Lighty, and XtremIO client interface.<span id="more-3654"></span></p>
<h1>IOPS</h1>
<p>The XtremIO client has a nice dashboard that show immediatly the IO rate:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/09/CaptureXIO011.jpg" rel="lightbox[3654]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/09/CaptureXIO011.jpg" alt="CaptureXIO011" width="789" height="509" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3660" /></a></p>
<p>The instant view shows 120 KIOPS here and details on the block size.
The history show that the rate can be sustained.
This is not a production workload. I took the screenshots while dbms_resource_manager.io_calibrate was running</p>
<h1>IO calibrate</h1>
<p>Of course, you want to see the io_calibrate output:
<pre>
max_iops = 122935
latency  = 3
max_mbps = 3084
</pre></p>
<p>There is one information &#8211; the most important one for Auto DOP &#8211; that is not displayed but we can check it here:</p>
<p><pre>
SQL&gt; select * from resource_io_calibrate$;

  MAX_IOPS   MAX_MBPS  MAX_PMBPS    LATENCY  NUM_DISKS
---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
    122935       3084       1364          3          2
</pre>
One process can sustain 1.3GB/s. This do not depend on the storage but on the server. That is coming from an &#8216;old&#8217; E5-2667.
I can run a lot of processes and I&#8217;ve a 4 nodes RAC. The storage can sustain 3GB/s
And we have reached 120 KIOPS.</p>
<p>The storage here is one EMC XtremIO one X-Brick.</p>

<h1>Orachrome Lighty</h1>
<p>The &#8216;Real Time&#8217; view of Lighty show basic info from V$ views, calculating deltas and showing them graphically.
So here are the figures from the database:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/09/CaptureXIO012.jpg" rel="lightbox[3654]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/09/CaptureXIO012.jpg" alt="CaptureXIO012" width="705" height="426" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3659" /></a></p>
<p>Of course you can see the same figures from Enterprise Manager f you have Diagnostic Pack:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/09/CaptureXIO014.jpg" rel="lightbox[3654]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/09/CaptureXIO014.jpg" alt="CaptureXIO014" width="1294" height="565" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3655" /></a></p>
<h1>OEM &#8211; ASM</h1>
<p>ASM comes with performance metrics as well and can be seen from Enterprise Manager:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/09/CaptureXIO013.jpg" rel="lightbox[3654]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/09/CaptureXIO013.jpg" alt="CaptureXIO013" width="745" height="680" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3658" /></a></p>
<h1>Compression</h1>
<p>Performance is not the only feature of XtremIO. You have compression as well. These performance figures come from a database that takes only 35% of its size:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/09/CaptureXIO022.jpg" rel="lightbox[3654]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/09/CaptureXIO022.jpg" alt="CaptureXIO022" width="409" height="478" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3656" /></a></p>
<p>If you have read compression ratios from EMC marketing, then you have here a proof that you can achieve that compression ratio on a regular ERP (only numbers and some text. No images, no documents.)</p>
<p>Compression without performance overhead is a great feature of XtremIO. There is another one: snapshots without performance overhead on source. But that is for another time.</p>
