								<h1 class="entry-title">Feedback on my session at Oracle Open World 2016</h1>

			<p>I was a speaker at Oracle Open World and received the feedback and demographic data. this session took place on the Sunday, which is the User Group Forum day about Multitenant, defining what is the multitenant architecture and which features it brings to us even wen we dont&#8217; have the multitenant option. Unfortunately, I cannot upload the slides before the next 12<em>c</em> release is available. If you missed the session or want to hear it in my native language, I&#8217;ll give it in Geneva on 23rd of November at Oracle Switzerland office.

<p>Here is the room when we was setting up de demo on my laptop, but from demographic statistics below 84 people attended (or planned to attend) my session.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2016/10/2016-09-18-10.28.07.jpg" rel="lightbox[12280]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2016/10/2016-09-18-10.28.07.jpg" alt="2016-09-18 10.28.07" width="567" height="425" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12286" /></a></p>
<h3>Feedback survey</h3>
<p>Depending on the conferences, the percentage of people that fill the feedback goes from low to very low. Here 6 people gave feedback wich is 7% or the attendees: </p>
<p><em> Number of Respondents: <strong>6</strong>
 Q1: How would you rate the content of the session? (select a rating of 1 to 3, 3 being the best): <strong>2.67</strong>
 Q2: How would you rate the speaker(s) of the session? (select a rating of 1 to 3, 3 being the best): <strong>2.83</strong>
 Q3: Overall, based on content and speakers I would rate this session as (select a rating of 1 to 3, 3 being the best): <strong>2.67</strong></em></p>
<p>Thanks for this. But most important is the quality than the quantity. I received only one comment and this one is very important for me because it can help me to improve my slide:</p>
<p><em>Heavy accent was difficult  to understand at times where I lost interest/concentration. Ran through slides too quick (understanding time  constraints). Did not allow image capturing (respected). Did provide examples which was nice. Advised slides will be downloadable&#8230;to be seen.</em></p>
<p>The accent is not a surprise. It&#8217;s an international event a lot of people coming from all around the world may have accent that is difficult to understand. I would love to speak English more clearly but I know that my French accent is there, and my lack of vocabulary as well. That will be hard to change. But the remark about the slides is very pertinent. I usually put lot of material in my presentations: lot of slides, lot of texts, lot of demos. My idea is that you don&#8217;t need to read all what is written. It is there to read it later when you download the slides (I expected the 12<em>c</em>R2 to be fully available for OOW when I prepared the slides). And it&#8217;s also there in case my live demos fails so that I&#8217;ve the info on the slides, but I usually skip them quickly when all was seen in the demo.</p>
<p>But thanks to this comment, I understand that reading the slides is important when you don&#8217;t get what I say, and having too much text makes it difficult to follow. For future presentations, I&#8217;ll remove text from slides and put it as powerpoint presenter notes, made available in the pdf. </p>
<p>So thanks for the one that has written this comment. I&#8217;ll improve that. And don&#8217;t hesitate to ping me to know when the slides can be downloadable, and maybe I can already share a few ones.</p>
<h3>Demographic data</h3>
<p>Open World gives some demographic data about attendees. As at the Sunday Session you don&#8217;t have to scan you badge, I suppose it&#8217;s about people that registered and may not have been there. But intention counts <img src="../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>About countries: we were in US so that&#8217;s the main country represented here. Next comes 6 people from Switzerland, the country where I live and work:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2016/10/CaptureOOW16demoCountries84.png" rel="lightbox[12280]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2016/10/CaptureOOW16demoCountries84.png" alt="CaptureOOW16demoCountries84" width="902" height="540" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12283" /></a></p>
<p>When we register to OOW we fill-in the industry we are working on. The most represented in the room were Financial, Heathcare, High Tech:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2016/10/CaptureOOW16demoIndustries84.png" rel="lightbox[12280]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2016/10/CaptureOOW16demoIndustries84.png" alt="CaptureOOW16demoIndustries84" width="795" height="379" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12282" /></a></p>
<p>And the job title which is a free text have several values, which makes it difficult to aggregate:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2016/10/CaptureOOW16demoJobtitles84.png" rel="lightbox[12280]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2016/10/CaptureOOW16demoJobtitles84.png" alt="CaptureOOW16demoJobtitles84" width="1132" height="850" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12281" /></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s no surprise that there were a lot of DBAs. I&#8217;m happy to see some managers/supervisors interested in technical sessions.
My goal for future events is to get more attention from developers because a database is not a black box storage for data, but a full software where data is processed.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that 84 people were in that room actually, there were several good sessions at the same time, as well as the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1401060563535050">bridge run</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2016/10/oo1Csp1eTvXgAABNcH.jpg" rel="lightbox[12280]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2016/10/oo1Csp1eTvXgAABNcH.jpg" alt="oo1Csp1eTvXgAABNcH" width="889" height="571" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12288" /></a></p>
<p>This is the kind of slides where there&#8217;s lot of text but I go fast. Actually I had initially 3 slides about this point (feature usage detection, multitenant and CON_IDs). I removed some, and kept one with too much text. When I remove slides, I usually post a blog about what I&#8217;ll not have time to detail. </p>
<p>Here are those posts:</p>

<h3>Thanks</h3>
<p>My session was part of part of the stream which was selected by the EMEA Oracle Usergroup Community. Thanks a lot to EOUC. They have good articles in their newly created magazine <a href="http://www.oraworld.org">www.oraworld.org</a>. Similar name but nothing to do with the team of worldwide OCMs and ACEs publishing for years as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/oraworldteam/">Oraworld Team</a>.</p>

		<p>Dear Franck,</p>
<p>a suggestion for slides is: have a lot to say, but keep the presentation short. You could present 10 slides in 30 minutes and share an extended version for download. That could help.</p>
<p>Kind regards
 Thomas
