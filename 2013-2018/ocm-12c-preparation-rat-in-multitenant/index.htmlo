			<p>I have several customers that have cases where Real Application Testing can be interesting, but they don&#8217;t use it because it&#8217;s an expensive option. Which is why it&#8217;s probably the topic listed for OCM 12c exam where I&#8217;ve the less experience. And I don&#8217;t even know at which level (CDB or PDB) it has to be run in multitenant. So I&#8217;ve tested it and came to a surprise.
<span id="more-6173"></span>
In Enterprise Manager, when you select Database Replay from a PDB:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/12/CaptureReplay002.jpg" rel="lightbox[6173]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/12/CaptureReplay002.jpg" alt="CaptureReplay002" width="308" height="357" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6176" /></a></p>
<p>It seems that you go back at CDB level:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/12/CaptureReplay003.jpg" rel="lightbox[6173]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/12/CaptureReplay003.jpg" alt="CaptureReplay003" width="531" height="120" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6175" /></a></p>
<h3>Capture</h3>
<p>From there I&#8217;ve run a small capture, using the most simple and the default settings from the OEM wizard, and got a capture that has no reference to the PDB:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/12/CaptureReplay004.jpg" rel="lightbox[6173]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/12/CaptureReplay004.jpg" alt="CaptureReplay004" width="772" height="328" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6174" /></a></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t hesitate to comment here because that looks strange for me that I cannot capture at PDB level.</p>
<h3>Replay</h3>
<p>So while the capture was running, I&#8217;ve created the SCOTT schema with utlsampl.sql and I&#8217;ve raised all salaries in EMP.
Now, to replay in the same state, I&#8217;ve re-created the SCOTT schema.</p>
<p>And once again, using all defaults in OEM wizard. But the replay had 2 errors:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/12/CaptureReplayError.jpg" rel="lightbox[6173]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/12/CaptureReplayError.jpg" alt="CaptureReplayError" width="736" height="267" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6180" /></a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s probably a way to see the statements, but first I check the error messages:
<pre>
[oracle@VM111 ~]$ oerr ora 01918
01918, 00000, "user '%s' does not exist"
// *Cause:  User does not exist in the system.
// *Action: Verify the user name is correct.
[oracle@VM111 ~]$ oerr ora 65049
65049, 00000, "creation of local user or role is not allowed in CDB$ROOT"
// *Cause:   An attempt was made to create a local user or role in CDB$ROOT.
// *Action:  If trying to create a common user or role, specify CONTAINER=ALL.
//
</pre>
As I know that the capture, running utlsampl.sql, did DROP USER SCOTT and then CREATE USER SCOTT, I can imagine that the replay was running on the CDB$ROOT.</p>
<p>I did the replay again, and the reason is clear. Because I&#8217;m at CDB level de defaut connection string for replay clients connects to the CDB$ROOT:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/12/CaptureReplayErrorCDB.jpg" rel="lightbox[6173]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/12/CaptureReplayErrorCDB.jpg" alt="CaptureReplayErrorCDB" width="766" height="511" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6179" /></a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s change it to PDB service name:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/12/CaptureReplayErrorPDB.jpg" rel="lightbox[6173]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2015/12/CaptureReplayErrorPDB.jpg" alt="CaptureReplayErrorPDB" width="765" height="508" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6178" /></a></p>
<p>There I thought that the workload replay client had to connect to PDB but:</p>
<p><pre>
oracle@VM111 ~]$ wrc system/oracle@//vm111/PDB replaydir=/tmp/replay

Workload Replay Client: Release 12.1.0.2.0 - Production on Sun Dec 20 14:55:02 2015

(wrc_main_6062.trc) ORA-15554: cannot start workload replay client because the database server is not in PREPARE mode
</pre></p>
<p>then I connect to the CDB$ROOT and everything is ok:
<pre>
[oracle@VM111 ~]$ wrc system/oracle replaydir=/tmp/replay

Workload Replay Client: Release 12.1.0.2.0 - Production on Sun Dec 20 14:55:17 2015

Wait for the replay to start (14:55:17)
Replay client 1 started (14:55:39)
</pre></p>
<p>With this configuration, the replay had no errors: SCOTT recreated and salaries updated.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>My conclusion here is that everything about RAT is done at CDB level (but you can filter to capture only what happens on one PDB).</p>
