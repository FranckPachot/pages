			<p>This error message is misleading. You may encounter it when you expect ORA-00942: table or view does not exist. Let&#8217;s explain
<span id="more-9382"></span>
I&#8217;m connected as SCOTT and create a PUBLIC SYNONYM for an object that do not exists:
<pre>
SQL&gt; create public synonym MONEY for NOTHING;
Synonym created.
</pre>
No error message.
Only when I read it I have an error message telling me that there are no table or view behind it:
<pre>
SQL&gt; select * from NOTHING;
select * from NOTHING
              *
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-00942: table or view does not exist
</pre></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s do the same but call it BONUS instead of MONEY:
<pre>
SQL&gt; create public synonym BONUS for NOTHING;
Synonym created.

SQL&gt; select * from BONUS;
no rows selected
</pre>
No error here. Why? because I&#8217;ve a table that is called BONUS. So the name is resolved with the table and the synonym is not even tried.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll now drop that synonym and create it for the table BONUS. Same name for the public synonym and for the table.
<pre>
SQL&gt; drop public synonym BONUS;
Synonym dropped.

SQL&gt; create public synonym BONUS for BONUS;
Synonym created.
</pre></p>
<p>As user SCOTT, when I query BONUS the name is resolved as the table:
<pre>
SQL&gt; show user
USER is "SCOTT"
SQL&gt; select * from BONUS;
no rows selected
</pre></p>
<p>As another user, when I query BONUS the name is resolved as the synonym, which finally reads SCOTT.BONUS:
<pre>
SQL&gt; show user
USER is "SCOTT"
SQL&gt; select * from BONUS;
no rows selected
</pre></p>
<p>In 12c it is easy to see the final query:
<pre>
SQL&gt; variable c clob
SQL&gt; exec dbms_utility.expand_sql_text('select * from BONUS',:c);
PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.

SQL&gt; print c

C
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT "A1"."ENAME" "ENAME","A1"."JOB" "JOB","A1"."SAL" "SAL","A1"."COMM" "COMM" FROM "SCOTT"."BONUS" "A1"
</pre></p>
<p>But now, what happens when we drop the table?
<pre>
SQL&gt; drop table SCOTT.BONUS;
Table dropped.
</pre></p>
<p>Do you expect a ORA-00942: table or view does not exist?
<pre>
SQL&gt; select * from BONUS;
select * from BONUS
              *
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-01775: looping chain of synonyms
</pre></p>
<p>Here is the &#8216;looping chain of synonyms&#8217;. I ask for BONUS. The name resolution first check for an object in my schema, but there are none:
<pre>
SQL&gt; select object_type from user_objects where object_name='BONUS';
no rows selected
</pre></p>
<p>Then it looks for public synonym and there is one:
<pre>
SQL&gt; select object_type from all_objects where owner='PUBLIC' and object_name='BONUS';

OBJECT_TYPE
-----------------------
SYNONYM
</pre></p>
<p>So we check what it is a synonym for:
<pre>
SQL&gt; select table_owner,table_name from all_synonyms where owner='PUBLIC' and synonym_name='BONUS';

TABLE_OWNER  TABLE_NAME
------------ ------------
SCOTT        BONUS
</pre>
And there it is interesting. Besides the column names that includes &#8216;TABLE&#8217; a synonym can reference any object. So it&#8217;s not just replacing the synonym with &#8216;SCOTT.BONUS&#8217; which would raise an ORA-00942. It is doing name resolution of BONUS in the context of the user SCOTT. Something similar to:
<pre>
SQL&gt; alter session set current_schema=SCOTT;
Session altered.
SQL&gt; select * from BONUS;
</pre>
And then, what do you expect from that? There is no table named BONUS but there is a public synonym&#8230; and you&#8217;re back to the begining:
<pre>
select * from BONUS
              *
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-01775: looping chain of synonyms
</pre></p>
<p>Most of the time, you don&#8217;t have synonyms that reference other synonyms, so you don&#8217;t really have a &#8216;chain&#8217; of synonyms. Except when there is only synonym in the namespace and it&#8217;s a self-reference loop. So if you see ORA-01775, check if the referenced object is not missing.</p>
