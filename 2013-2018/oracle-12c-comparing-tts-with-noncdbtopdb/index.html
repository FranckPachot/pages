			<p>How to migrate from non-CDB to CDB? Of course all known migration methods works. But there is also another solution: upgrade to 12c if necessary and then convert the non-CDB to a PDB. This is done with the noncdb_to_pdb.sql which converts a non-CDB dictionary to a PDB one, with metadata and object links. But do you get a clean PDB after that ? I tested it and compared the result with same database migrated by transportable tablespaces.</p>
<h3>The test case</h3>
<p>In 12c I can use Full Transportable database, but here I&#8217;ve only one tablespace as I&#8217;m doing my comparison on an empty database with the EXAMPLE schemas.</p>
<p>Here is my database:</p>

---- -------- -------------------- ------- ------------------------
1    790      SYSTEM               YES     /u01/app/oracle/oradata/NDB1/system01.dbf
3    610      SYSAUX               NO      /u01/app/oracle/oradata/NDB1/sysaux01.dbf
4    275      UNDOTBS1             YES     /u01/app/oracle/oradata/NDB1/undotbs01.dbf
5    1243     EXAMPLE              NO      /u01/app/oracle/oradata/NDB1/example01.dbf
6    5        USERS                NO      /u01/app/oracle/oradata/NDB1/users01.dbf
</pre>
<p>It&#8217;s a new database, created with dbca, all defaults, and having only the EXAMPLE tablespace. SYSTEM is 790MB and SYSAUX is 610MB. We can have a lot of small databases like that, where system size is larger than user size and this is a reason to go to multitenant.</p>
<p>I will compare the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the migration with transportable tablespaces (into pluggable database PDB_TTS)</li>
<li>the plug and run noncdb_to_pdb (into the pluggable database PDB_PLG)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Transportable tablespace</h3>
<p>Transportable tablespace will plug only the non system tablespaces and all the dictionary entries are recreated while importing metadata. Here it is:</p>
<pre class="brush: sql; gutter: true; first-line: 1">SQL&gt; alter tablespace EXAMPLE read only;
Tablespace altered.
SQL&gt; host expdp '"/ as sysdba"' transport_tablespaces='EXAMPLE'
</pre>
<p>The log gives me the dump file (containing the metadata) and the datafiles to copy:</p>
<pre class="brush: actionscript3; gutter: true; first-line: 1">Master table "SYS"."SYS_EXPORT_TRANSPORTABLE_01" successfully loaded/unloaded
******************************************************************************
Dump file set for SYS.SYS_EXPORT_TRANSPORTABLE_01 is:
  /u01/app/oracle/admin/NDB1/dpdump/expdat.dmp
******************************************************************************
Datafiles required for transportable tablespace EXAMPLE:
  /u01/app/oracle/oradata/NDB1/example01.dbf
Job "SYS"."SYS_EXPORT_TRANSPORTABLE_01" successfully completed at ... elapsed 00:03:55
</pre>
<p>then on the destination I create an empty pluggable database:</p>
<pre class="brush: sql; gutter: true; first-line: 1">SQL&gt; create pluggable database PDB_TTS admin user pdbadmin identified by "oracle" file_name_convert=('/pdbseed/','/PDB_TTS/');
SQL&gt; alter pluggable database PDB_TTS open;
SQL&gt; alter session set container=PDB_TTS;
</pre>
<p>and import the metadata after having copied the datafile to /u03:</p>
<pre class="brush: sql; gutter: true; first-line: 1">SQL&gt; create or replace directory DATA_PUMP_DIR_NDB1 as '/u01/app/oracle/admin/NDB1/dpdump';
SQL&gt; host impdp '"sys/oracle@//vm211:1666/pdb_tts as sysdba"' transport_datafiles=/u03/app/oracle/oradata/PDB_TTS/example01.dbf directory=DATA_PUMP_DIR_NDB1
</pre>
<p>which took only two minutes because I don&#8217;t have a lot of objects. That&#8217;s all. I have a brand new pluggable database where I&#8217;ve imported my tablespaces.</p>
<p>Here I used the transportable tablespace and had to pre-create the users. But in 12c you can do everything with Full Tabsportable Database.</p>
<h3>noncdb_to_pdb.sql</h3>
<p>The other solution is to plug the whole database, including the SYSTEM and SYSAUX tablespaces, and then run the noncdb_to_pdb.sql script to transform the dictionary to a multitenant one. First, we generate the xml describing the database, which is similar to the one generated when we unplug a PDB:</p>
<pre class="brush: sql; gutter: true; first-line: 1">SQL&gt; shutdown immediate
SQL&gt; startup open read only;
SQL&gt; exec dbms_pdb.describe('/tmp/NDB01.xml');
</pre>
<p>And then plug it:</p>
<pre class="brush: sql; gutter: true; first-line: 1">SQL&gt; CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE PDB_PLG USING '/tmp/NDB01.xml' COPY FILE_NAME_CONVERT = ('/u01/app/oracle/oradata/NDB1', '/u03/app/oracle/oradata/PDB_PLG');
</pre>
<p>At that point I can open the PDB but it will act as a Non-CDB, with its own dictionary that is not linked to the root. For example, you have nothing when you query DBA_PDBS from the PDB:</p>
<pre class="brush: sql; gutter: true; first-line: 1">SQL&gt; show con_id
CON_ID
------------------------------
6
SQL&gt; select * from dba_pdbs;
no rows selected
</pre>
<p>I put in my todo list to test what we can do in that PDB which is not yet a PDB before raising lot of ORA-600.</p>
<p>Now you have to migrate the dictionary to a PDB one. The noncdb_to_pdb.sql will do internal updates to transform the entries in OBJ$ to be metadata links.</p>
<pre class="brush: sql; gutter: true; first-line: 1">SQL&gt; alter session set container=PDB_PLG;
SQL&gt; @?/rdbms/admin/noncdb_to_pdb;
SQL&gt; alter pluggable database PDB_PLG open;
</pre>
<p>The updates will depend on the number of dictionary objects, so that is fixed for the version. And the remaining time is to recompile all objects, but that can be done in parallel. Here, I&#8217;ve run it in serial to see how long it takes (screenshot from Lighty):</p>

<h3>Comparison</h3>
<p>My goal was to compare both methods. As I expected, the SYSTEM and SYSAUX tablespaces did not decrease when using the noncdb_to_pdb, so if you want to go to multitenant to save space, the noncdb_to_pdb method is not the good one:</p>

<p>Here I&#8217;ve compared the dictionary sizes. While the PDB_TTS table segments are below 100MB, the PDB_PLG is the same size as the root.

<p>The IDL_UB1$ is the table that contains all the pcode for pl/sql. All those wrapped dbms_ packages are there. And we don&#8217;t need them in the PDB: we have link to the root which has exactly the same version.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>My conclusion is that I&#8217;ll not advise to use using noncdb_to_pdb. First, that script doing a lot of internal stuff scares me. I prefer to start that new implementation of the dictionary with a clean one.</p>
<p>But now that I made this test, I&#8217;ve two additional reasons to avoid it. First, it&#8217;s not faster &#8211; except if you have a lot of objects. And the main goal is to reduce the total space by having the oracle packages stored only once. And this is cleary not done by the noncdb_to_pdb.</p>
<p>However, that conclusion is only for small databases. If you a database with a huge number of objects and pl/sql packages, then the overhead to keep the dictionary objects will not be very significant. And the TSS solution will be longer because it has to import all metadata. So there is still a case for noncdb_to_pdb. But test is before. And be sure to have a large shared pool for the recompile step.</p>
<p><strong>Update 1</strong>: I forgot to add another reason to be very careful with noncdb_to_pdb from Bertrand Drouvot in his <a href="https://bdrouvot.wordpress.com/2014/10/17/watch-out-for-optimizer_adaptive_features-as-it-may-have-a-huge-negative-impact">post about optimizer_adaptive_features huge negative impact on it.</a></p>
<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: From a comment on <a href="https://community.oracle.com/thread/3635717?sr=inbox&amp;ru=7404">OTN forum</a> I changed the sentence about deleted rows because it was wrong. In fact, rows are deleted when the objects are recompiled:</p>

</pre>
<p>The issue is only that space is still allocated. And you can&#8217;t SHRINK those objects because SYSTEM is DMT, and anyway the large tables contain LONG, and finally:</p>

<p>Of course, the space can be reused, but do you expect to add 200MB of compiled pl/sql in future releases?</p>
