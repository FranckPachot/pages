			<p>Today at #ukoug_tech16 12:30 in hall 11A I&#8217;ll talk about <a href="http://www.tech16.ukoug.org/default.asp?p=14778&amp;dlgact=shwprs&amp;prs_prsid=11948&amp;day_dayid=102" target="_blank">Statistics Gathering Best Practice &amp; 12cR2 Statistics Advisor</a>
Rather than taking the Optimizer Statistics Advisor rules one by one I&#8217;ll show the things to take care (some people may call it best practices) when  gathering statistics and they mention the Statistics Advisor Rule.
If you need a reference about all rules, you can get it from V$STATS_ADVISOR_RULES

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</pre>
I&#8217;ll explain them briefly here.</p>
<p>You should always enable to automatic statistic gathering job. You may manage special cases manually, but do not disable it.
<pre>  1 Use Auto Job for Statistics Collection (UseAutoJob)</pre>
For sure if the job does not complete successfully, the advisor detects the probable cause.
<pre>  2 Auto Statistics Gather Job should complete successfully (CompleteAutoJob)</pre>
Statistics history may save your life in case of a regression. But be sure the retention is not too large and purge occurs or SYSAUX will grow
<pre>  3 Maintain Statistics History (MaintainStatsHistory)</pre>
The faster the statistics gathering run, the more statistics you can gather. Use all your server resources for it.
<pre>  4 Use Concurrent preference for Statistics Collection (UseConcurrent)</pre>
Default options for global preferences are what the optimizer developers think are the best for most cases.
<pre>  5 Use Default Preference for Stats Collection (UseDefaultPreference)</pre>
Humm.. this one was introduced before the decision not to activate SPD by default
(see <a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/oracle-12cr2-optimizer-adaptive-statistics/" target="_blank">http://blog.dbi-services.com/oracle-12cr2-optimizer-adaptive-statistics/</a>)
<pre>  6 SQL Plan Directives should not be disabled (TurnOnSQLPlanDirective)</pre>
Setting statistics manually may be used as a workaround but not the general case
<pre>  7 Avoid Set Statistics Procedures (AvoidSetProcedures)</pre>
When you run dbms_stats.gather_&#8230;_stats manually, default options are what the optimizer developers think are the best for most cases.
<pre>  8 Use Default Parameters in Statistics Collection Procedures (UseDefaultParams)</pre>
And in those cases, better to run it for a schema so that you are sure to include newly created tables
<pre>  9 Use gather_schema_stats procedure (UseGatherSchemaStats)</pre>
You waste time and ressources if you gather statistics in a addition to what is done with online statistics gathering
<pre> 10 Avoid inefficient statistics operation sequences (AvoidInefficientStatsOprSeq)</pre>
You waste time and ressources if you gather statistics when nothing has changed
<pre> 11 Avoid unnecessary statistics collection (AvoidUnnecessaryStatsCollection)</pre>
You need statistics for all tables
<pre> 12 Avoid objects with stale or no statistics (AvoidStaleStats)</pre>
Statistics gathered before bulk inserts will be immediately stale
<pre> 13 Do not gather statistics right before bulk DML (GatherStatsAfterBulkDML)</pre>
You don&#8217;t want the automatic statistics gathering run on a table between a truncate and an insert
<pre> 14 Statistics for objects with volatile data should be locked (LockVolatileTable)</pre>
But let it run for tables with no massive change
<pre> 15 Statistics for objects with non-volatile should not be locked (UnlockNonVolatileTable)
 16 Statistics of dependent objects should be consistent (MaintainStatsConsistency)</pre>
Better truncate, make indexes unusable, and insert /*+ append */ than drop and recreate the table (which removes statistics).
<pre> 17 Avoid drop and recreate object seqauences (AvoidDropRecreate)</pre>
Statistics advisor may detect when incremental statistics gathering is me efficient for partitioned tables
<pre> 18 Statistics should be maintained incrementally when it is beneficial (UseIncremental)
 19 Statistics should not be maintained incrementally when it is not beneficial (NotUseIncremental)</pre>
Stale statistics may lead to under-estimation because of linear decay
<pre> 20 Avoid Out of Range Histogram endpoints (AvoidOutOfRange)</pre>
Large tables can be scanned in parallel, recommendation is default degree
<pre> 21 Use Auto Degree for statistics collection (UseAutoDegree)</pre>
As we have seen about global preferences, table preference should be default for most cases (rolling invalidation, auto sample size, auto histogram size)
<pre> 22 Use Default Object Preference for statistics collection (UseDefaultObjectPreference)</pre>
And for sure dbms_stats is the way to gather statistics for the optimizer. ANALYZE is deprecated for that since 91
<pre> 23 Avoid using analyze table commands for statistics collection (AvoidAnalyzeTable)</pre></p>
<p>Those are only my interpretation. 12.2 is new (and cloud first) and I&#8217;ve not observed all those recommandations yet. But there are properly described by the advisor.
This is the kind of output we can get:

GENERAL INFORMATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Task Name       : MY_TASK
 Execution Name  : EXEC_52
 Created         : 12-07-16 11:31:40
 Last Modified   : 12-07-16 11:32:37
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 For execution EXEC_52 of task MY_TASK, the Statistics Advisor has 6
 finding(s). The findings are related to the following rules: USECONCURRENT,
 AVOIDSETPROCEDURES, USEDEFAULTPARAMS, USEGATHERSCHEMASTATS, AVOIDSTALESTATS,
 UNLOCKNONVOLATILETABLE. Please refer to the finding section for detailed
 information.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FINDINGS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rule Name:         UseConcurrent
 Rule Description:  Use Concurrent preference for Statistics Collection
 Finding:  The CONCURRENT preference is not used.

 Recommendation:  Set the CONCURRENT preference.
 Example:
 dbms_stats.set_global_prefs('CONCURRENT', 'ALL');
 Rationale:  The system's condition satisfies the use of concurrent statistics
             gathering. Using CONCURRENT increases the efficiency of statistics
             gathering.
