			<p>Do you look at memory advisors? I usually don&#8217;t but I still show them during the performance tuning workshop because there is no easy way to get an idea about memory sizing. This morning, while giving the training, I&#8217;ve shown on our workshop environment what the problem is: they are based on statistics cumulated from instance startup, which can cover months of heterogeneous activity, and then the result is probably meaningless.</p>
<p>If you want to trust advisors, then you need to know on which measures it is based. Let&#8217;s check it.</p>
<h3>V$DB_CACHE_ADVISOR</h3>
<p>Here is how we query the V$DB_CACHE_ADVISOR in order to see the estimated physical reads for different buffer cache size:</p>
<pre class="brush: sql; gutter: true; first-line: 1">SQL&gt; 
SELECT a.size_for_estimate "Buffer size MB",
       a.size_factor "Factor size",
       round(a.estd_physical_read_time/1000,2) "Estim. time (s)",
       a.estd_physical_read_factor "Estim. time factor",
       a.estd_physical_reads "Estim. nb physical read"
FROM  sys.v$db_cache_advice a
WHERE a.name='DEFAULT'
ORDER BY a.size_for_estimate;

<p>Look at the factor 1 &#8211; the current values. The advisor is based on 2.7 million physical reads. Let&#8217;s see if it is based on statistics since instance startup or a shorter period.</p>
<h3>V$SYSTAT</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ll display the instance statistics (cumulative since instance startup) that measure physical reads:</p>
<pre class="brush: sql; gutter: true; first-line: 1">SQL&gt; select value,name from v$sysstat where name like 'physical reads %';

     VALUE NAME
---------- ----------------------------------------------------------------
   2760403 physical reads cache
  86342292 physical reads direct
     33656 physical reads direct temporary tablespace
     76909 physical reads cache prefetch
     13105 physical reads prefetch warmup
         0 physical reads retry corrupt
      3428 physical reads direct (lob)
         0 physical reads for flashback new
         0 physical reads cache for securefile flashback block new
         0 physical reads direct for securefile flashback block new

</pre>
<p>Here it&#8217;s clear: the advisor was based on the 2.7 million physical reads to cache. Those values are cumulated from instance startup. If the instance have been started a long time ago then there is nothing relevant here: activity is not regular, memory component have been resized several times, etc. And if the instance has been started recently, then the cache activity is not significant: you did lot of physical reads to load the cache.</p>
<h3>AWR / Statspack</h3>
<p>Ok. we know that V$ views are cumulative from instance start. When we want to look at statistics on a shorter period of time we have AWR or Statspack. Here is the Buffer Cache advisor section:</p>

<p>this looks like the cumulative values from instance startup. But I want to be sure &#8211; not guess. The instance statistics section can show get the number of physical reads to cache during this period of time:</p>
<pre class="brush: actionscript3; gutter: true; first-line: 1">Instance Activity Stats                         DB/Inst: DB1/DB1  Snaps: 60-61

physical reads                                1,973           22.9         140.9
physical reads cache                          1,863           21.7         133.1
</pre>
<p>only few thousand of them here. This confirms that the advisor is not based on delta values.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>From what we see, the memory advisors are based on values cumulated since instance startup. I always advise to focus the performance analysis on a short period where activity is regular. Then I can&#8217;t advise to use those advisors. You can look at it in the few following days after instance startup, just to have an idea, but don&#8217;t rely only on that. In my opinion, that a bug. there is no reason to show cumulative values in a Statspack / AWR report. I think that the advisor can do similar estimations on delta values. Anyone volunteer to open a bug ?</p>

		<p>In an 11.2.0.4 AWR, Instance Activity Stats shows Physical Reads 86million and the Buffer Pool Advisory shows 45million. In 11.2.0.3 I see the Buffer Pool Advisory showing a much higher count than the Instance Activity Stats.

		<p>Hi Hemant,
This post is just coming from one quick test, so maybe I made the conclusion too quickly. I&#8217;ll check that in depth from DBA_HIST. For Statspack it&#8217;s easy we can read the code the we know where the figures comes from.
thanks,
Franck.
