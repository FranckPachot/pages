								<h1 class="entry-title">PDB upgrade from 12c to 18c</h1>
		<div class="content-inner">
			
						
						
		   
			<p>Oracle 18c is out, in the Oracle Cloud, and the first thing I do with a new version is testing how long it takes to upgrade a previous version PDB by unplug/plug. Faster upgrade should be the benefit of having a slim dictionary where the system objects are reduced to metadata links and data links. However, it looks like upgrading the PDB dictionary still takes the same time as upgrading the CDB$ROOT.</p>
<p>The idea is to create a DBaaS service with a new CDB in 18.1 and plug a PDB coming from 12.2.0.1. Actually, I&#8217;m saying 18.1 but that may be 18.0 as I&#8217;m now lost in those version numbers. The cloud service was created with version: &#8220;18.0.0.0&#8221;, V$VERSION displays 18.1.0.0 for the release and 18.0.0.0 for the version:
<pre>Connected to:
Oracle Database 18c Enterprise Edition Release 18.0.0.0.0 - Production
Version 18.1.0.0.0</pre>
My understanding is that the 18.0.0.0 is the version of the 18c dictionary, which will need a full upgrade only for 19c (19.0.0.0). And 18.1.0.0 is about the version, which will be incremented by Release Updates later.
<span id="more-21512"></span></p>
<p>I have an unplugged PDB that I plug into the new CDB:
<pre>SQL&gt; create pluggable database PDB0 using '/u01/app/temp/PDB0.pdb';
Pluggable database PDB0 created.</pre></p>
<p>When I open it, I get a warning:
<pre>SQL&gt; alter pluggable database pdb0 open;

ORA-24344: success with compilation error
24344. 00000 -  "success with compilation error"
*Cause:    A sql/plsql compilation error occurred.
*Action:   Return OCI_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO along with the error code

Pluggable database PDB0 altered.
</pre></p>
<p>Then I check the PDB PLUG IN VIOLATIONS:

<pre>SQL&gt; select * from pdb_plug_in_violations;

Here we see 18.1 but the important number is the time: 21 minutes&#8230; Once again, I see no improvement in the time to upgrade the PDB dictionary. This was on a service with 2 OCPU and I&#8217;ve run a whole CDB upgrade with a similar shape and the time to upgrade the CDB$ROOT is exaclty the same &#8211; see the screenshot on the right.</p>
<p>Finally I open the PDB:
<pre>
SQL&gt; alter pluggable database pdb0 open;
Pluggable database PDB0 altered.
</pre></p>
<p>And check that the violations are resolved:

Ok, I suppose I can ignore that as this is not RAC.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve not seen a lot of differences in the dbupgrade output. There&#8217;s a new summary of versions before and after upgrade, which was not there in 12c:</p>
<p><pre>DOC&gt;#####################################################
DOC&gt;#####################################################
DOC&gt;
DOC&gt;    DIAG OS Version: linux x86_64-linux-thread-multi 2.6.39-400.211.1.el6uek.x86_64

</pre></p>
<p>However, be careful with this information. The OS Version is not correct:
<pre>
[opc@DB ~]$ uname -a
Linux DB 4.1.12-112.14.10.el6uek.x86_64 #2 SMP Mon Jan 8 18:24:01 PST 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
</pre>
It seems that this info comes from Config.pm which is the OS version where the perl binaries were built&#8230;</p>
<p>In summary, nothing changes here about the time it takes to upgrade a PDB when plugged into a new CDB.
However, in 18c (and maybe only with next Release Updates) we should have a way to get this improved by recording the upgrade of CDB$ROOT and re-playing a trimmed version on the PDB dictionaries, in the same way as in Application Containers for application upgrades. We already see some signs of it with &#8216;_enable_cdb_upgrade_capture&#8217; undocumented parameter and PDB_UPGRADE_SYNC database property. This may even become automatic when PDB is opened with the PDB_AUTO_UPGRADE property. But that&#8217;s for the future, and not yet documented. </p>
<p>For the moment, you still need to run a full catupgrd on each container, through catctl.pl called by the &#8216;dbupgrade&#8217; script. Here on a 2 OCPU service, it takes 20 minutes.</p>
