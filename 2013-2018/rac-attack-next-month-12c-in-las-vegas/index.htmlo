<td valign="middle">RAC is the most complex installation you can have for an oracle database. A RAC DBA is involved not only on database, but storage, network, and system as well. It involves also the application in order to be sure that the application service can follow the database service high availability. It&#8217;s also brings every database skills to the highest level: small contention on single instance database can become a big bottleneck in RAC.</p>
<p>But RAC is also fascinating. It&#8217;s the highest service availability. When correctly configured you can stop a node without any impact on your users. It&#8217;s the highest scalability: you are not limited by the number of CPU or the amount of memory that you can put in a server. Just add a node. RAC is not new. Oracle 6 was already able to open the same database from several instances. It was called parallel server.</p>
<p>Do you think it&#8217;s impossible to learn and practices that king of infrastructure when you don&#8217;t have already one in your data center? No. You can install and practice RAC on your laptop. This is what RAC Attack! is about: at various events, experienced RAC Attack volunteers (ninjas) will help you address any related issues and guide you through the setup process and you will have a RAC on your laptop. Next month in Las Vegas is the IOUG event: COLLABORATE15. I&#8217;ll be there as a speaker and I&#8217;m also very happy to help as a RAC Attack! Nija.</p>
<p>Here you can find all information about it:</p>
