								<h1 class="entry-title">Redo log block size on ODA X6 all flash</h1>
		<div class="content-inner">
			
						
						
		   
			<p>On the Oracle Database Appliance, the redo logs are on Flash storage (and with X6 everything is on Flash storage) so you may wonder if we can benefit from 4k redo blocksize. Here are some tests about it on an ODA X6-2M.
<span id="more-9817"></span>
I&#8217;ll compare the same workload (heavy inserts) with 512 bytes and 4k bytes block size redo. However, we can&#8217;t create a log group different than 512 bytes:
<pre>
ORA-01378: The logical block size (4096) of file
/u03/app/oracle/redo/LABDB1/onlinelog/o1_mf_999_%u_.log is not compatible with
the disk sector size (media sector size is 512 and host sector size is 512)</pre></p>
<p>This is because the flash storage is exposed with 512 bytes sector size:</p>
<p><pre>ASMCMD&gt; lsdg
State    Type    Rebal  Sector  Block       AU  Total_MB  Free_MB  Req_mir_free_MB  Usable_file_MB  Offline_disks  Voting_files  Name
MOUNTED  NORMAL  N         512   4096  4194304   4894016  4500068          2441888         1023992              0             Y  DATA/
MOUNTED  NORMAL  N         512   4096  4194304   1231176   221172           610468         -199762              0             N  RECO/</pre></p>
<p>Then, in order to be able to create new redo log groups with higher block size you need to set &#8220;_disk_sector_size_override&#8221; to TRUE;</p>
<p>I have 3 log groups with 512 bytes block size, and 3 groups with 4k:</p>
<p><pre>
LOGFILE
  GROUP 10 '+RECO/LABDB1/ONLINELOG/group_10.264.917867333'  SIZE 51200M BLOCKSIZE 512,
  GROUP 11 '+RECO/LABDB1/ONLINELOG/group_11.265.917867489'  SIZE 51200M BLOCKSIZE 512,
  GROUP 12 '+RECO/LABDB1/ONLINELOG/group_12.266.917867645'  SIZE 51200M BLOCKSIZE 512,
  GROUP 13 '+RECO/LABDB1/ONLINELOG/group_13.267.917867795'  SIZE 51200M BLOCKSIZE 4096,
  GROUP 14 '+RECO/LABDB1/ONLINELOG/group_14.268.917867913'  SIZE 51200M BLOCKSIZE 4096,
  GROUP 15 '+RECO/LABDB1/ONLINELOG/group_15.269.917868013'  SIZE 51200M BLOCKSIZE 4096
</pre></p>
<p>In 12<em>c</em> the database files should be on ACFS and not directly on the diskgroup. We did this on purpose in order to check if there is any overhead when in ACFS and we have seen exactly the same performance in both. There is something I dislike here however: redo log files are not multiplexed with multiple log members, but rely on the diskgroup redundancy. I agree with that in ASM because you are not supposed to manage the files and then risk to delete one of them. But in ACFS you see only one file, and if you drop it by mistake, both mirrors are lost, with the latest transactions.</p>
<p>On an insert intensive workload I take AWR snapshots between two log switches:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2016/07/ODAX6REDO.png" rel="lightbox[9817]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2016/07/ODAX6REDO.png" alt="ODAX6REDO" width="1563" height="985" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9825" /></a>
The switch between blocksize 512 and blocksize 4096 happened at 12:35</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be nervous about those orange &#8216;log file sync waits&#8217; we had to run 10000 transactions per second in order to get some contention here.</p>
<p>We have to go to the details in order to compare, from an AWR Diff report:</p>

<p>Few milliseconds are not perceived by end-user at commit except if the application has a design that is so bad that hundreds of commits are done for each user interaction. Even if both are really fast, the log writers was above 1ms for writes only for 1% of them when in blocksize 4k vs. 15% with default blocksize.</p>
<p>This faster latency is measured by I/O statistics as well:</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve added a few things that were masked by the AWR Diff Report. The writes lower than 4k is zero in the second snapshots because it&#8217;s the blocksize.
It&#8217;s interesting to see that redo size is higher and this is because you write 4k even when you have less. This is measured by &#8216;redo wastage&#8217;. </p>
<p>So, larger blocksize lowers the latency but increases the volume. Here, where NVMe optimizes the bandwidth to Flash storage, it may not be a problem.</p>
<h3>So what?</h3>
<p>You have to keep in mind that this workload, with lot of small transactions and no other waits, is a special workload for this test. If you are not in this extreme case, then the default block size is probably sufficient for latency and reduces the redo size. However, if log file sync latency is your bottleneck, you may consider increasing the blocksize.</p>
