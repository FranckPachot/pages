								<h1 class="entry-title">Running SLOB on Exadata Express Cloud Service</h1>
		<div class="content-inner">
			
						
						
		   
			<p>The Exadata Express Cloud Service is a managed PDBaaS: Oracle is the system admin and the CDB database administrator, you are the PDB administrator. You connect with a local user, PDB_ADMIN, which is no SYSDBA privilege but has a PDB_DBA which has nearly all DBA rights, but with some features disabled by lockdown profile.
I have no worry about the performance on this service: it is an Exadata X5 half rack bare metal (my guess), the CDB running as RAC One Node on 2 compute nodes, accessing the 7 storage cells. Smart Scan is disabled and given the small size of the PDB, and the low usage of the CDB, I/O is fast (most single block latency bwtween 128 and 256us coming from cell flash cache).
But I like to run SLOB on new platforms and I wanted to see if I can run it here, without SYSDBA role, and connecting to a CDB.
You can find SLOB at <a href="https://kevinclosson.net/slob/" target="_blank">https://kevinclosson.net/slob/</a>
<span id="more-14554"></span></p>
<h3>TNS_ADMIN</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ll connect remotely because SLOB will be running on my computer (I have no access to the host for the PDBaaS managed service). In order to connect remotely, through a SQL*Net over SSL, you have to download the client credentials kit
<a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2017/01/CaptureEXCS017.png" rel="lightbox[14554]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2017/01/CaptureEXCS017.png" alt="CaptureEXCS017" width="952" height="219" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14557" /></a></p>
<p>It is a zip file that contains the encryption wallet and the sqlnet.ora and tnsnames.ora to use. I unzip it in a directory (/var/tmp/client_credentials in this example) and I&#8217;ll use it by setting the TNS_ADMIN environment to this directory.
Thus I change the wallet location in the sqlnet.ora:
$ cat sqlnet.ora
<pre>WALLET_LOCATION = (SOURCE = (METHOD = file)
                   (METHOD_DATA = (DIRECTORY="$TNS_ADMIN")))
</pre>
and I use the provided tnsnames.ora which defines the &#8216;dbaccess&#8217; service:
<pre>$ cat tnsnames.ora
dbaccess = (description=
          (address=(protocol=tcps)(port=1522)(host=dbaccess.us2.oraclecloudapps.com))
          (connect_data=(service_name=eptdojjm1ag.usdc2.oraclecloud.com))
          (security=(ssl_server_cert_dn="CN=dbaccess.us2.oraclecloudapps.com,O=Oracle Corporation,L=Redwood Shores,ST=California,C=US"))
       )</pre></p>
<h3>Changes in slob.conf</h3>
<p>The default slob.conf connects with a bequeath connection. Here I need to connect through the network service described above. I uncommented:
<pre>
#ADMIN_SQLNET_SERVICE=slob
#SQLNET_SERVICE_BASE=slob
#SYSDBA_PASSWD=change_on_install
</pre>
and replaced it with:
<pre>
ADMIN_SQLNET_SERVICE=dbaccess
SQLNET_SERVICE_BASE=dbaccess
SYSDBA_PASSWD=xxxxxxxxx
</pre></p>
<p>Where xxxxxxxxx is my PDB_ADMIN password that I setup in:
<a href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2017/01/CaptureEXCS0241.png" rel="lightbox[14554]"><img src="../wp-insides/uploads/sites/2/2017/01/CaptureEXCS0241-300x204.png" alt="CaptureEXCS024" width="300" height="204" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14555" /></a></p>
<p>Of course we need an Oracle Client. Download instant client if you don&#8217;t have one.</p>
<h3>Changes in setup.sh</h3>
<p>SLOB creates the users and grant them RESOURCE,DBA
In Exadata Express Cloud Service, I don&#8217;t have the DBA role but the CREATE SESSION, and the PDB_ROLE which is sufficient. In addition to that I need to give quota to the IOPS tablespace because PDB_ADMIN do not have unlimited tablespace. Finally here is the create user part after my modifications:</p>
<p><pre>
msg NOTIFY "Creating user: $user "

sqlplus "$constring" &lt;&lt;EOF
WHENEVER SQLERROR EXIT 2;
SET TERMOUT ON
SET ECHO ON
PROMPT User grants for $user
WHENEVER SQLERROR EXIT 2;
GRANT CREATE SESSION TO $user IDENTIFIED BY $user;
GRANT PDB_DBA TO $user;
ALTER USER $user DEFAULT TABLESPACE $tablespace ;
ALTER USER $user QUOTA UNLIMITED ON $tablespace ;
EXIT;
EOF
</pre></p>
<p>The setup.sh starts by dropping the SLOB schemas up to MAX_SLOB_SCHEMAS just in case they are there. The default is 4096 but that&#8217;s too much for me because of the latency to the server in US (it is planned to have Exadata Express Cloud Service in Europe in the future), so I reduced it to 8 (as I have only 1 CPU in this service, there&#8217;s no need for more users):
<pre>
export MAX_SLOB_SCHEMAS=8
</pre></p>
<p>And last modification in setup.sh was to disable the Multitenant checking because PDBaaS is by definition on a Multitenant database:</p>
<p><pre>
if ( ! check_mto "$ADMIN_CONNECT_STRING")
then
        msg FATAL ""
        msg FATAL "This version of SLOB does not support Oracle Multitenant Option"
        msg FATAL
        #exit 1
fi
</pre></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve not seen any problem. Oracle designed multitenant so that everything you used to do on a database is possible to do on a PDB.</p>
<h3>Changes in runit.sh</h3>
<p>First, in order to connect as PDB_ADMIN instead of SYS as SYSDBA, you have to change the admin_connect_string:
<pre>
        export admin_connect_string="pdb_admin/${SYSDBA_PASSWD}@${ADMIN_SQLNET_SERVICE}"
</pre></p>
<p>Second, SLOB calls UTL_FILE which is not allowed in Exadata Express Cloud Service. Becase I&#8217;ve seen in the code that this is bypassed when the &#8216;nt&#8217; argument is 1 so I&#8217;ve set it to this value in runit.sh:
<pre>
        arg9=1 #was: $nt
</pre></p>
<p>Finally, because we can&#8217;t create manual AWR snapshots in Exadata Express Cloud Service, I replaced the EXEC DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPOSITORY.CREATE_SNAPSHOT by the creation of a small view to get the basic statistics:
<pre>
create or replace view FPAV as
select 'STAT' class,name,value from V$SYSSTAT
union all
select 'WAIT' class,event,total_waits from V$SYSTEM_EVENT
union all
select 'TIME' class,stat_name,value from V$SYS_TIME_MODEL
union all
select 'V$OS' class,stat_name,value from V$OSSTAT
union all
select 'MICRO' class,event||' - '||wait_time_format,wait_count from V$EVENT_HISTOGRAM_MICRO
;
create table FPAT as select sysdate time,FPAV.* from FPAV where 1=0;
insert into FPAT select sysdate time,FPAV.* from FPAV;
commit;
</pre></p>
<p>and I replaced the part that runs the AWR report with a simple query:</p>
<p><pre>
($admin_conn &lt;&lt;EOF
set echo on heading on underline on linesize 120 trimspool on pagesize 1000;
host cat slob.conf &gt; awr.txt
spool awr.txt append
commit;
column per_sec format 999G999G999G999G999
select to_char(btim,'hh24:mi:ss') btime,to_char(time,'hh24:mi:ss')etime,seconds,class,name,round(delta/seconds) per_second , decode(class||' '||name
 ,'STAT session logical reads','LIO/s'
 ,'STAT physical read total IO requests','PIO/s'
 ,'TIME DB CPU','CPU us'
 ,'TIME DB time','DB time us'
 ,'STAT physical read total bytes','Read B/s'
 ,'STAT physical write total bytes','Write B/s'
 ,'V$OS BUSY_TIME','OS busy cs'
 ,'WAIT resmgr:cpu quantum','resmgr'
) main from (
 select
 FPAT.*
 ,max(time)over(order by time rows between unbounded preceding and unbounded following) last
 ,value-lag(value)over(partition by class,name order by time) delta
 ,(time-lag(time)over(partition by class,name order by time))*24*60*60 seconds
 ,lag(time)over(partition by class,name order by time) btim
 from FPAT
) where time=last and delta&gt;0 order by main,per_second desc;
spool off
host cp awr.txt awr$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).txt
exit
EOF
) &amp;
</pre></p>
<p>Statspack is not an alternative here because it requires some views and grants from SYS which you cannot do on Exadata Express Cloud Service. I really don&#8217;t understand why we cannot use AWR locally because in 12.2 you can have AWR snapshots at PDB level. But any use of dbms_workload_repository is disabled by lockdown profile.</p>
<h3>Result</h3>
<p>So this is the kind of output I get on running 2 SLOB sessions during 10 minutes:</p>

<p>1.96 CPU seconds per second and 1.98 DB time. Those are my 2 cached SLOB sessions.
About 1.2 million LIO per seconds. This is what I expect from those test on Exadata X5 (PCT_UPDATE=0 and WORK_UNIT=64).
Resource manager ready to kick in as my CPU_COUNT is set to 2 in my PDB (set by lockdown profile, you cannot change it)
The overall system hosting the CDB has been mostly idle: 3.91 / (67.87 + 3.91) is 5.44% busy. I&#8217;m responsible for 2 sessions over 72 threads (36 cores): 2/72=2.78% CPU usage</p>
<p>The Exadata Express Cloud Service allocates 1 core (2 threads) but because the system is nearly idle, I didn&#8217;t use 2 threads of the same core. Let&#8217;s compare with a 1 session only run:</p>

<p>Comparing logical reads, 1228557/668368=1.8 so probably I was not running the two sessions on the same core.</p>
<h3>So what?</h3>
<p>SLOB (<a href="https://kevinclosson.net/slob/">https://kevinclosson.net/slob/</a>) doesn&#8217;t need to be installed on the database server because it is mostly PL/SQL, so no roundtrips. And this is a way to run it when you have only access to a PDB without SYSDBA privileges.</p>
