<h3>The script</h3>
<p>The LASTAWRSEC.sql used here script get the latest snapshot from DBA_HIST_SNAPSHOT for the current instance and calls DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPOSITORY.AWR_REPORT_TEXT to get the report. Then it adds a column with the section name (I&#8217;ve listed the sections available in 12.1.0.2 &#8211; you may have to modify that list) and the script accepts two parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>&amp;1 is a regexp to apply to the section name</li>
<li>&amp;2 is a regexp applied to the report line (can be the empty string)</li>
</ul>
<p>and they are combined with a &#8216;or&#8217;. I use that to get the Top event section and a few instance statistics in addition to that.</p>
<p>So here is the script:</p>
<pre class="brush: actionscript3; gutter: true; first-line: 1">with snap as (
  select * from (
    select dbid,lead(snap_id)over(partition by instance_number order by end_interval_time desc) bid,snap_id eid,row_number() over(order by end_interval_time desc) n
    from dba_hist_snapshot where dbid=(select dbid from v$database)
  ) where n=1
),
awr as (
        select rownum line,output
        from table(
                dbms_workload_repository.awr_report_text(l_dbid=&gt;(select dbid from snap),l_inst_num=&gt;(select instance_number from v$instance),l_bid=&gt;(select bid from snap),l_eid=&gt;(select eid from snap),l_options=&gt;1+4+8)
        )
),
awr_sections as (
        select
         last_value(case when regexp_replace(output,' *DB/Inst.*$') in (''

		<p>Hi Frank,
This is awesome script. I had multiple scripts in my respository to pull each section based on awr snap which I can replace with this script. I slightly modified script to prompt for number of days which will further displays list of snaps and based on input entered for start/end snap it will display awr section for that input.</p>
<p>Thanks,
Vishal
