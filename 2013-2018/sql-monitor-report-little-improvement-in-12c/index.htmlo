			<p>This is a very short post about something I though I had already blogged about.</p>
<p>I like SQL Monitoring active reports. The are graphical, and still very light. There is only one thing I don&#8217;t like about it in 11g and it has been improved in 12c
Look at the following. The query has run for 1.1 minute. And from the &#8216;Database Time&#8217; line we can see that it used mostly CPU. If you&#8217;re not familiar with the color, just move the mouse above it and you will see the wait event and the number of samples.</p>
<p><a class="easyblog-thumb-preview" title="Capture001_20150415-204039_1.JPG" href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/images/easyblog_images/139/Capture001_20150415-204039_1.JPG" rel="lightbox[1885]"><img title="b2ap3_thumbnail_Capture001_20150415-204039_1.JPG" src="../images/easyblog_images/139/b2ap3_thumbnail_Capture001_20150415-204039_1.JPG" alt="b2ap3_thumbnail_Capture001_20150415-204039_1.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>Then I want to check which line in my execution plan is responsible for most of that time:</p>
<p><a class="easyblog-thumb-preview" title="Capture002_20150415-204038_1.JPG" href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/images/easyblog_images/139/Capture002_20150415-204038_1.JPG" rel="lightbox[1885]"><img title="b2ap3_thumbnail_Capture002_20150415-204038_1.JPG" src="../images/easyblog_images/139/b2ap3_thumbnail_Capture002_20150415-204038_1.JPG" alt="b2ap3_thumbnail_Capture002_20150415-204038_1.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>Look: there is no &#8216;Database Time column&#8217;. There is one for CPU and one for wait events. But that is not very helpful and misleading. Above, it looks like a large percentage of samples concerns wait events. But that&#8217;s only the percentage relative to wait events.
Because I&#8217;ve seen before that most of the time is spent on CPU, I have to look at the CPU column only.</p>
<h4>12c</h4>
<p>This has changed in 12c. there is only one column called &#8216;Activity %&#8217; so the lines with a high percentage are those where the most of time is spend:</p>
<p><a class="easyblog-thumb-preview" title="Capture004.JPG" href="http://blog.dbi-services.com/images/easyblog_images/139/Capture004.JPG" rel="lightbox[1885]"><img title="b2ap3_thumbnail_Capture004.JPG" src="../images/easyblog_images/139/b2ap3_thumbnail_Capture004.JPG" alt="b2ap3_thumbnail_Capture004.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>Remember, this is sampling, not profiling. But if you apply the percentage to the total time, then you have a good estimation of the time spend on each part of the plan.
(the screenshot above has no sample about the I/O that occured, but the will show in the same column)</p>
<p>This is very useful when you have a long query with a long execution plan.
Of course, this requires Tuning Pack. I&#8217;ll share in a future post how I approach that when having only Diagnostic Pack.</p>
