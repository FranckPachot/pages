								<h1 class="entry-title">The future of SQL*Plus and some oddities</h1>
		<div class="content-inner">
			
						
						
		   
			<p>Rumors are coming after OOW14. Oracle is working on a new SQL*Plus version. Not only a new version. It&#8217;s a completely new development. Here is what we know currently about the future of sqlplus an sqldeveloper. But I start with some very old stuff.</p>
<h3>SQL*Plus</h3>
<p>sqlplus is an old tool. With many features that look as oddities today.</p>
<p>You want to see some oddities? Good idea because it can be error-prone. Without knowing them, an error when commenting out a line can be very problematic:</p>
<pre class="brush: sql; gutter: true; first-line: 1">SQL&gt; create table MY_DUAL ( DUMMY varchar2(1) );
Table created.

SQL&gt; insert into MY_DUAL values ('X');
1 row created.

SQL&gt; /*I've inserted only one row, right?*/
1 row created.

SQL&gt; select count(*) from MY_DUAL;

  COUNT(*)
----------
         2
</pre>
<p>Yes, my comment without a space after the &#8216;/*&#8217; executed the previous command again, as does the &#8216;/&#8217;</p>
<p>Another one? Imagine that by mistake you comment a line using the linux comments &#8216;#&#8217;</p>
<pre class="brush: sql; gutter: true; first-line: 1">SQL&gt; # drop table MY_DUAL;
Table dropped.
</pre>
<p>The command was executed. The &#8216;#&#8217; executes the command. What is the reason for that? Imagine I&#8217;m typing a long pl/sql and I want to run a describe in order to check table columns. I&#8217;m in 1985 so I just can&#8217;t open a new window.</p>
<pre class="brush: sql; gutter: true; first-line: 1">SQL&gt; declare
  2   cursor c is select * from SCOTT.EMP where
  3  # -- what are the columns of EMP ?
  3  # -- ok let's get them:
  3  # desc SCOTT.EMP
 Name                                      Null?    Type
 ----------------------------------------- -------- ----------------------------
 EMPNO                                     NOT NULL NUMBER(4)
 ENAME                                              VARCHAR2(10)
 JOB                                                VARCHAR2(9)
 MGR                                                NUMBER(4)
 HIREDATE                                           DATE
 SAL                                                NUMBER(7,2)
 COMM                                               NUMBER(7,2)
 DEPTNO                                             NUMBER(2)

  3    mgr is null;
  4  begin
  5   null;
  6  end;
  7  .
SQL&gt; l
  1  declare
  2   cursor c is select * from SCOTT.EMP where
  3    mgr is null;
  4  begin
  5   null;
  6* end;
SQL&gt;
</pre>
<p>Great, I was able to run a command without disturbing the statement I was writing. Cool feature in 1985. Risky feature in 2014. Still there for compatibility. Up to you to disable it with:</p>
<pre class="brush: sql; gutter: true; first-line: 1">SQL&gt; set sqlprefix off
SQL&gt; #drop table MY_DUAL;
SP2-0734: unknown command beginning "#drop tabl..." - rest of line ignored.
</pre>
<h3>SQL Developer</h3>
<p>SQL Developer was a nice evolution. I use it a lot. I don&#8217;t know enough all the possibilities. For example I discovered only very recently that there is a command line access to SQL Developer which has a few features:</p>
<pre>F:\ora\sqldeveloper\sqldeveloper\bin&gt;sdcli
Available features:
cart: Database Cart Batch Tasks
dba: Basic Batch DBA Tasks
format: SQL Format Task
migration: Database Migration Tasks
reports: Basic Batch Reporting Tasks
unittest: Unit Testing Batch Tasks
</pre>
<p>More info about it on jeff Smith blog</p>
<h3>SQL Developer 4.1</h3>
<p>At Oracle Open World, Jeff Smith (Product Manager of SQL Developer) not only organized the Golden Gate Run, but also unveiled a few SQL developer 4.1 new features. It&#8217;s not only a tool for developers, but you can do many DBA or monitoring tasks from it.</p>
<p>His presentation is <a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2014/connect/fileDownload/session/B1FE70947C1D9FE63E8D76DEFC7B2410/CON7326_Smith-OOW14WhatsNewSQLDEV41.pptx">here</a></p>
<h3>A new SQL*Plus?</h3>
<p>If you follow Kris Rice tweets you have probably seen a few teasers about a new sqlplus coming. Yes, they are completely rewriting sqlplus.
Here is an example:</p>
<blockquote lang="en"><p>A little more of a preview of what we&#8217;re building. <a href="http://t.co/Xfx01EexRf">http://t.co/Xfx01EexRf</a></p>
<p>— krisrice (@krisrice) <a href="https://twitter.com/krisrice/status/528200484142989314">October 31, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>What we can expect?</p>
<ul>
<li>Auto completion (proposes table names in the same way as linux bash proposes file names)</li>
<li>Statement history in the same way we do with our <a href="http://www.dbi-services.com/offering/products/database-management-kit-dmk">DMK</a></li>
<li>simple command to get the create statements, such as: &#8216;DDL EMP&#8217; to show the &#8216;CREATE TABLE EMP &#8230;&#8217; statement</li>
</ul>
<p>Another teaser screenshot:</p>
<blockquote lang="en"><p>
How about this one? What else should be there? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/orclapex?src=hash">#orclapex</a> <a href="http://t.co/J7oLzMGaHd">pic.twitter.com/J7oLzMGaHd</a></p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Because, as a consultant, I&#8217;m often going to new environments where I have to adapt to the customer tools, I prefer to use the tools that are easily available. sqlplus is always there. sqldeveloper is easy to install (just unzip and it connects through jdbc).SQL Developer is shipped in ORACLE_HOME snce 11g. It&#8217;s not the latest version but you will be happy to find it if you&#8217;re not allowed to install anything. And I&#8217;m not talking only about customer environments, but if you have to take a hands-on certification exam you will also appreciate <img src="../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<h4>A small update:</h4>
<p>it&#8217;s not a rewrite of sqlplus but rather using the sqldeveloper sqlplus engine.</p>
