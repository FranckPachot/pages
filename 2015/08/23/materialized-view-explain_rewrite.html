			<p>When I passed the OCM 11g exam, I had to prepare the &#8216;Manage Materialized Views to improve rewrite&#8217; topic. Now that I&#8217;m preparing the <a href="https://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=5001&amp;get_params=p_exam_id:12COCMU" title="12COCMU" target="_blank">12c upgrade</a> I checked quickly what I&#8217;ve prepared&#8230; and it doesn&#8217;t work. This post is about query rewrite, a bug in 12c, how to understand why it doesn&#8217;t rewrite, and how rewrite is accepted when constraints are not enforced and when materialized view is stale.
<span id="more-3061"></span></p>
<h1>SCOTT</h1>
<p>
I start with the SCOTT schema where I alter EMP to define DEPTNO as not null, meaning that I&#8217;ve a one-to-many association.
<pre>
SQL&gt; host sqlplus / as sysdba @ ?/rdbms/admin/utlsampl
SQL&gt; alter table SCOTT.EMP modify ( DEPTNO not null);
Table altered.
</pre>
And I&#8217;ll need a few additional grants for my test.
<pre>
SQL&gt; grant create materialized view, select any dictionary to scott;
Grant succeeded.
</pre>
</p>
<h1>Create materialized view</h1>
<p>
I&#8217;m creating a materialized view that join the two tables DEPT and EMP
<pre>
SQL&gt; connect scott/tiger
Connected.
SQL&gt;
SQL&gt; create materialized view TEST_MV enable query rewrite
  2   as
  3   select * from DEPT join EMP using (DEPTNO);
Materialized view created.
</pre>
I check that query_rewrite_integrity is enabled
<pre>
SQL&gt; show parameter rewrite

NAME                                 TYPE        VALUE
------------------------------------ ----------- ------------------------------
query_rewrite_enabled                string      TRUE
query_rewrite_integrity              string      enforced
</pre>
and run a query on EMP. The query should be able to read the materialized view instead of the table, because it has all rows and all columns. Because the cost may not be better, I force the query rewrite with the REWRITE_OR_ERROR hint: force the rewrite and fail if not possible.
<pre>
SQL&gt; set autotrace on explain
SQL&gt; select /*+ rewrite_or_error */ * from EMP;
select /*+ rewrite_or_error */ * from EMP
                                      *
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-30393: a query block in the statement did not rewrite

SQL&gt; set autotrace off
</pre>
Hummm. No rewrite. If you try it on 11.2.0.3 query rewrite occurs. But not in 11.2.0.4 not in 12.1
</p>
<h1>Explain rewrite</h1>
<p>
When you have to understand why query rewrite do not occur, you can have more information with <strong>dbms_mview.explain_rewrite</strong>. In 11g we had the possibility to do it easily with dbconsole, but in 12c there is nothing in EM Express nor in SQL Developer. If I&#8217;m wrong, please tell me.
</p>
<p>
Thus, we have to use it in command line. First, we need to create the EXPLAIN_REWRITE table to store the result.
<pre>
SQL&gt; @ ?/rdbms/admin/utlxrw.sql

and call the explain_rewrite procedure with the statement, and to materialized view:
<pre>
SQL&gt; exec dbms_mview.explain_rewrite('select * from EMP','TEST_MV');

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.
</pre>
and check the result:
<pre>
SQL&gt; select sequence,message from REWRITE_TABLE  order by statement_id,sequence;

  SEQUENCE MESSAGE

</pre>
But there is no reason there. It&#8217;s like the materialized view cannot even be considered for query rewrite. Well, I&#8217;ll not go into the detail here. I&#8217;ve opened bug 17651484 for that. There is a problem since 11.2.0.4 where query uses ANSI join. I like ANSI join syntax, but here I have to avoid them.

and now check rewrite:

Good. Query rewrite occured. Here is the output from explain rewrite:
<pre>
SQL&gt; delete from REWRITE_TABLE;
2 rows deleted.

SQL&gt; exec dbms_mview.explain_rewrite('select * from EMP','TEST_MV');
PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.</p>

         1 QSM-01151: query was rewritten
         2 QSM-01033: query rewritten with materialized view, TEST_MV
</pre>
From now, I&#8217;ll use only explain_rewrite to check different variations.
</p>
<h1>Disabled constraint</h1>
<p>
Constraints are not only there to verify integrity constraints, but also to give information to the optimizer. I&#8217;ve added the not null before because using the join instead of the table is possible only when we know that all rows from EMP have a matching row in DEPT. Now let&#8217;s see what happens if I remove the constraint:
<pre>
SQL&gt; alter table EMP disable constraint FK_DEPTNO;
Table altered.</p>
<p>SQL&gt; delete from REWRITE_TABLE;
2 rows deleted.</p>
<p>SQL&gt; exec dbms_mview.explain_rewrite('select * from EMP','TEST_MV');
PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.</p>
<p>SQL&gt; select sequence,message from REWRITE_TABLE  order by statement_id,sequence;</p>
<p>  SEQUENCE MESSAGE
---------- ------------------------------------------------------------
         1 QSM-01150: query did not rewrite
         2 QSM-01110: query rewrite not possible with materialized view
            TEST_MV because it contains a join between tables (EMP and
           DEPT) that is not present in the query and that potentially
           eliminates rows needed by the query
         3 QSM-01052: referential integrity constraint on table, EMP, n
           ot VALID in ENFORCED integrity mode
</pre>
The explain rewrite tells me everything. The join may eliminate rows, and the disabled constraint cannot ensure that no rows are eliminated.
</p>
<h1>RELY constraint</h1>
<p>
If you know that your data verifies the constraint, and don&#8217;t want the overhead to validate it, you can alter the constraint to RELY so that the optimizer can rely on it.
<pre>
SQL&gt; alter table EMP modify constraint FK_DEPTNO rely;
Table altered.</p>
<p>SQL&gt; delete from REWRITE_TABLE;
3 rows deleted.</p>
<p>SQL&gt; exec dbms_mview.explain_rewrite('select * from EMP','TEST_MV');
PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.</p>
<p>SQL&gt; select sequence,message from REWRITE_TABLE  order by statement_id,sequence;</p>
<p>  SEQUENCE MESSAGE
---------- ------------------------------------------------------------
         1 QSM-01150: query did not rewrite
         2 QSM-01110: query rewrite not possible with materialized view
            TEST_MV because it contains a join between tables (EMP and
           DEPT) that is not present in the query and that potentially
           eliminates rows needed by the query
         3 QSM-01052: referential integrity constraint on table, EMP, n
           ot VALID in ENFORCED integrity mode
</pre>
But that&#8217;s not enough. We have to read the last message. It&#8217;s not sufficient to have the constraint in RELY, we have to be trusted by the query rewrite.
<pre>
SQL&gt; alter session set query_rewrite_integrity=trusted;
Session altered.</p>
<p>SQL&gt; delete from REWRITE_TABLE;
3 rows deleted.</p>
<p>SQL&gt; exec dbms_mview.explain_rewrite('select * from EMP','TEST_MV');
PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.</p>
<p>SQL&gt; select sequence,message from REWRITE_TABLE  order by statement_id,sequence;</p>
<p>  SEQUENCE MESSAGE
---------- ------------------------------------------------------------
         1 QSM-01151: query was rewritten
         2 QSM-01033: query rewritten with materialized view, TEST_MV
</pre>
Good. Now query rewrite occurs because I told the optimizer that it can RELY on the foreign key for the current data, and I told the query rewrite that it can trust me.</p>
<h1>STALE</h1>
<p>
Ok, but my constraint is still disabled. New DML will not be verified. The RELY concerns only current data. So what happens if I insert a row in EMP that has no matching DEPT?
<pre>
SQL&gt; insert into EMP (EMPNO,ENAME,DEPTNO) values (9999,'rebel',50);
1 row created.

SQL&gt; commit;
Commit complete.
</pre>
<pre>
SQL&gt; delete from REWRITE_TABLE;
2 rows deleted.</p>
<p>SQL&gt; exec dbms_mview.explain_rewrite('select * from EMP','TEST_MV');
PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.</p>
<p>SQL&gt; select sequence,message from REWRITE_TABLE  order by statement_id,sequence;</p>
<p>  SEQUENCE MESSAGE
---------- ------------------------------------------------------------
         1 QSM-01150: query did not rewrite
         2 QSM-01031: materialized view, TEST_MV, is stale in TRUSTED i
           ntegrity mode
</pre>
Because changes have been done, the materialized view is stale. We need to lower the query rewrite security level if we still want query rewrite:
<pre>
SQL&gt; alter session set query_rewrite_integrity=stale_tolerated;
Session altered.</p>
<p>SQL&gt; delete from REWRITE_TABLE;
2 rows deleted.</p>
<p>SQL&gt; exec dbms_mview.explain_rewrite('select * from EMP','TEST_MV');
PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.</p>
<p>SQL&gt; select sequence,message from REWRITE_TABLE  order by statement_id,sequence;</p>
<p>  SEQUENCE MESSAGE
---------- ------------------------------------------------------------
         1 QSM-01151: query was rewritten
         2 QSM-01033: query rewritten with materialized view, TEST_MV
</pre>
But then the select with query rewrite will not show all rows, because the row I&#8217;ve inserted into EMP is not in the join result.
</p>
<h1>ENFORCED</h1>
</p>
<p>So trusted may show wrong results when the constraint is not enabled. You need to enforce query rewrite integrity to avoid that.
<pre>
SQL&gt; alter session set query_rewrite_integrity=enforced;
Session altered.</p>
<p>SQL&gt; delete from REWRITE_TABLE;
2 rows deleted.</p>
<p>SQL&gt; exec dbms_mview.explain_rewrite('select * from EMP','TEST_MV');
PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.</p>
<p>SQL&gt; select sequence,message from REWRITE_TABLE  order by statement_id,sequence;</p>
<p>  SEQUENCE MESSAGE
---------- ------------------------------------------------------------
         1 QSM-01150: query did not rewrite
         2 QSM-01110: query rewrite not possible with materialized view
            TEST_MV because it contains a join between tables (EMP and
           DEPT) that is not present in the query and that potentially
           eliminates rows needed by the query
         3 QSM-01052: referential integrity constraint on table, EMP, n
           ot VALID in ENFORCED integrity mode
</pre>
In this case, query rewrite do not occur because the foreign key is not enforced by oracle (not enabled).
</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>
Query rewrite depends on referential integrity. When <strong>query_rewrite_integrity=enforced</strong>, the referential integrity must be enforced by oracle (constraint is validated and enabled). When <strong>query_rewrite_integrity=trusted</strong>, you are responsible about data integrity, and control whether rewrite can rely on your constraint, and even tolerate stale materialized view.
</p>
<p>
Don&#8217;t forget to call <strong>dbms_mview.explain_rewrit</strong>e after creating the <strong>rewrite_table</strong> with <strong>utlxrw.sql</strong></p>
