		<div class="content-inner">
			
						
						
		   
			<p>Going to multitenant architecture is not a big change. The administration things (DBA, monitoring, backups) connect to the CDB and the application things connect to the PDB. Without the multitenant option, it is still recommended to go to the CDB architecture. The non-CDB is deprecated and the multitenant architecture brings interesting features. People often ask how to name the CDB and the PDB, especially when they have naming rules or policies in the company. My recommendation is to name the PDB as you are used to naming the databases: the name often gives an idea of the data that is inside, the application, and the environment. The CDB is the container, and in my opinion, you should apply the same naming rules as for servers. Don&#8217;t forget that pluggable databases are made to be moved across CDB, so the CDB name should not depend on the content.</p>
<p>But, with single tenant, you have a one-to-one relationship between the CDB and the PDB and then may come the idea to set the same name for CDB and PDB&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure if it is supported or not and please, don&#8217;t do that.</p>
<p><span id="more-18466"></span></p>
<h3>Service Name</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s one rule: the service name must be unique on a server, especially when registered to the same listener. The PDB name will be the default service name registered by the PDB. And the DB_UNIQUE_NAME of the CDB will be the default service name registered by the CDB. Then the PDB name must be different than the DBA_UNIQUE_NAME.</p>
<p>With this rule, it should be possible to have the same name for the CDB (the DB_NAME) and the PDB, given that we have set a different DB_UNIQUE_NAME.</p>
<p>Here is an example. The name of my Container Database is CDB1. But as it is part of a Data Guard configuration I changed the unique name to CDB1A (and standby will be CDB1B).</p>
<p>Here are the services from by CDB:

<p>All are default services: CDB1A is the DB_UNIQUE_NAME, SYS$BACKGROUND for background processes, SYS$USERS when connecting without a service name, CDB1XDB is used to connec to XDB dispathers. PDB1 is the default service of my pluggable database PDB1.</p>

<p>There is just one additional service here: the GUI of my PDB (see <a href="../service-696c6f76656d756c746974656e616e74-has-1-instances/index.html" target="_blank">https://blog.dbi-services.com/service-696c6f76656d756c746974656e616e74-has-1-instances/</a>)</p>
<h3>ORA-65149</h3>
<p>Do you see any service named &#8216;CDB1&#8242; here? No. Then I should be able to create a PDB with this name.
<pre>
SQL&gt; create pluggable database CDB1 admin user admin identified by covfefe file_name_convert=('pdbseed','cdb1');

Error starting at line : 1 in command -
create pluggable database CDB1 admin user admin identified by covfefe file_name_convert=('pdbseed','cdb1')
Error report -
ORA-65149: PDB name conflicts with existing service name in the CDB or the PDB
65149. 00000 -  "PDB name conflicts with existing service name in the CDB or the PDB"
*Cause:    An attempt was made to create a pluggable database (PDB) whose
           name conflicts with the existing service name in the container
           database (CDB) or the PDB.
*Action:   Choose a different name for the PDB.
</pre></p>
<p>Ok. This is impossible. However, the error message is not correct. My PDB name does not conflict with existing service names. It may conflict with instance name or DB_NAME, but not with any service.</p>
<h3>NID</h3>
<p>As I&#8217;m not satisfied with this, I try to find another way to have the same name for CDB and PDB. I have a pluggable database named &#8216;PDB1&#8242; and I&#8217;ll try to change the CDB name to this:</p>

<p>What was forbidden with a wrong error message was made possible with this other way.</p>
<h3>So what?</h3>
<p>Please, do not take this as a solution. There is clearly a problem here. Maybe the documentation and error message are wrong. Maybe the NID has a bug, allowing to do something that should be blocked. Or the create pluggable database has a bug, blocking something that should be possible. Until this is fixed (SR opened) I would recommend that the PDB name is always different than the CDB name, independently of service names. Well, I would recommend it anyway as it brings a lot of confusion: when you mention a database name, people will not know whether you are referring to the CDB or the PDB. </p>
