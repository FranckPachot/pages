			<p>Multitenant architecture is not such a big change and this is why I recommend it when you start a project in 12<em>c</em> or if you upgrade to 12.2 &#8211; of course after thoroughly testing your application. However, there is a point where you may encounter problems on dictionary queries, because it is really a big change internally. The dictionary separation has several side effects. You should test carefully the queries you do on the dictionary views to get metadata. Here is an example of a bug I recently encountered.
<span id="more-18628"></span>
This happened with a combination of things you should not do very often, and not in a critical use case: query dictionary for constraints owned by your current schema, when different than the user you connect with.</p>
<p>I create two users: USER1 and USER2
<pre>SQL&gt; connect sys/oracle@//localhost/PDB1 as sysdba
Connected.
SQL&gt; grant dba to USER1 identified by USER1 container=current;
Grant succeeded.
SQL&gt; grant dba to USER2 identified by USER2 container=current;
Grant succeeded.
</pre></p>
<p>USER1 owns a table which has a constraint:
<pre>
SQL&gt; connect USER1/USER1@//localhost/PDB1
Connected.
SQL&gt; create table DEMO(dummy constraint pk primary key) as select * from dual;
Table DEMO created.
</pre></p>
<p>USER2 can access to the table either by prefixing it with USER1 or by setting the current_schema to USER1
<pre>
SQL&gt; connect USER2/USER2@//localhost/PDB1
Connected.
SQL&gt; alter session set current_schema=USER1;
Session altered.
</pre></p>
<h3>Bug</h3>
<p>Ok, now imagine you want to read constraint metadata for the current schema you have set:
<pre>
SQL&gt; select sys_context('USERENV','CURRENT_SCHEMA'), a.*
  2  from sys.dba_constraints a
  3       where owner = sys_context('USERENV','CURRENT_SCHEMA')
  4  /

no rows selected
</pre></p>
<p>No rows selected is a wrong result here because my current_schema is USER1 and USER1 has constraints:
<pre>
SQL&gt; select owner,constraint_name
  2  from sys.dba_constraints a
  3       where owner = 'USER1'
  4  /
OWNER  CONSTRAINT_NAME
-----  ---------------
USER1  PK
</pre></p>
<p>So, where&#8217;s the problem? Let&#8217;s have a look at the execution plan:
<pre>
SQL_ID  2fghqwz1cktyf, child number 0
-------------------------------------
select sys_context('USERENV','CURRENT_SCHEMA'), a.*  from
sys.dba_constraints a      where owner =
sys_context('USERENV','CURRENT_SCHEMA')

Plan hash value: 1258862619

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Id  | Operation                | Name                    | Starts | E-Rows | A-Rows |   A-Time   | Buffers |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|   0 | SELECT STATEMENT         |                         |      1 |        |      0 |00:00:00.32 |    2656 |
|   1 |  PARTITION LIST ALL      |                         |      1 |      2 |      0 |00:00:00.32 |    2656 |
|*  2 |   EXTENDED DATA LINK FULL| INT$INT$DBA_CONSTRAINTS |      2 |      2 |      0 |00:00:00.32 |    2656 |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Predicate Information (identified by operation id):
---------------------------------------------------

   2 - filter((("INT$INT$DBA_CONSTRAINTS"."OBJECT_TYPE#"=4 OR
              ("INT$INT$DBA_CONSTRAINTS"."OBJECT_TYPE#"=2 AND "INT$INT$DBA_CONSTRAINTS"."ORIGIN_CON_ID"=TO_NUMBER(SY
              S_CONTEXT('USERENV','CON_ID')))) AND "OWNER"=SYS_CONTEXT('USERENV','CURRENT_SCHEMA')))
</pre></p>
<p>I am in 12.2 and DBA_CONSTRAINTS reads from INT$DBA_CONSTRAINTS which reads from INT$INT$DBA_CONSTRAINTS and in multitenant this view being an extended data view will read from CDB$ROOT and from the current container. This is why we see EXTENDED DATA LINK FULL in the execution plan and up to this point the predicates are correct: &#8220;OWNER&#8221;=SYS_CONTEXT(&#8216;USERENV&#8217;,&#8217;CURRENT_SCHEMA&#8217;)</p>
<p>The execution through data link is run on each container with parallel processes: they switch to the container and run the underlying query on the view. But when I look at the sql trace of the parallel process running the query on my PDB I can see that the predicate on OWNER has replaced the SYS_CONTEXT(&#8216;USERENV&#8217;,&#8217;CURRENT_SCHEMA&#8217;) with the hardcoded value:
<pre>
SELECT /*+ NO_STATEMENT_QUEUING RESULT_CACHE (SYSOBJ=TRUE) OPT_PARAM('_ENABLE_VIEW_PDB', 'FALSE') */ OWNER,CONSTRAINT_NAME,CONSTRAINT_TYPE,TABLE_NAME,OBJECT_TYPE#,SEARCH_CONDITION,SEARCH_CONDITION_VC,R_OWNER,R_CONSTRAINT_NAME,DELETE_RULE,STATUS,DEFERRABLE,DEFERRED,VALIDATED,GENERATED,BAD,RELY,LAST_CHANGE,INDEX_OWNER,INDEX_NAME,INVALID,VIEW_RELATED,ORIGIN_CON_ID FROM NO_COMMON_DATA(SYS."INT$INT$DBA_CONSTRAINTS") "INT$INT$DBA_CONSTRAINTS" WHERE ("INT$INT$DBA_CONSTRAINTS"."OBJECT_TYPE#"=4 OR "INT$INT$DBA_CONSTRAINTS"."OBJECT_TYPE#"=2 AND "INT$INT$DBA_CONSTRAINTS"."ORIGIN_CON_ID"=TO_NUMBER('3')) AND "INT$INT$DBA_CONSTRAINTS"."OWNER"=q'"USER2"'
</pre></p>
<p>And unfortunately, this value is not the right one: USER2 is my connected user, but not the CURRENT_SCHEMA that I have set. In the same trace, I can see where this value comes from:
<pre>
select 'q''"' || SYS_CONTEXT('USERENV', 'CURRENT_SCHEMA') || '"''' from sys.dual
</pre></p>
<p>but it seems that the current_schema was lost through the call to the parallel process and the PDB switch to my container.</p>
<h3>Workaround</h3>
<p>The problem is easy to workaround. This works:
<pre>
SQL&gt; select owner,constraint_name
  2  from sys.dba_constraints a
  3       where owner = ( select sys_context('USERENV','CURRENT_SCHEMA') from dual )
  4  /

OWNER  CONSTRAINT_NAME
-----  ---------------
USER1  PK
</pre></p>
<p>And anyway, better to get the current schema before and pass it as a bind variable. The bind variables are passed correctly through data link queries:</p>
<p><pre>
SQL&gt; variable v varchar2(30)
SQL&gt; exec select sys_context('USERENV','CURRENT_SCHEMA') into :v from dual;

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.

SQL&gt; select sys_context('USERENV','CURRENT_SCHEMA'), a.*
  2  from sys.dba_constraints a
  3       --where owner = sys_context('USERENV','CURRENT_SCHEMA')
  4       where owner = :v
  5  /
</pre></p>
<h3>So what?</h3>
<p>The multitenant architecture is a real challenge for dictionary views. The dictionary is separated: system metadata in CDB$ROOT and user metadata in PDB. But, because of compatibility with non-CDB architecture, the dictionary views must show both of them, and this is where it becomes complex: what was separated on purpose has now to be merged. And complexity is subject to bugs. If you want to get an idea, have a look at dcore.sql in ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin and compare 11<i>g</i> version with 12<i>c</i> ones, with all the evolution in 12.1.0.1, 12.1.0.2 and 12.2.0.1</p>
